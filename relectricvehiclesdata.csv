1e5u44t,Type 2 to Schuko adapter issue,"Hi, I've 3 type2 to Schuko adapters that I've used over those years in Italian EnelX charging stations but I normally draw 500/800W and had no issue. Starting from this month I got a new charger and I can charge up to 2.1kW BUT after 1 minute of power higher than 1.3kW the charging station does the ""clack"" and disconnects the plug saying ""charge terminated"". I get no error and the help support says there is no error and that's probably my adapter.

The scheme should be correct, and works perfectly fine up to around 1kW, just I'd I exceed that the station disconnects. 
Between Pe-Pp a 680ohm 0.5W resistor for 20A max.
Between Pe-Cp a 1n4007-880ohm-switch to select from standby to charging.

When I disconnect the plug it's warm but not scolding hot, at around 35/40°C with an external temperature of 30°C so I don't think it's a plug overheating issue, also I can leave it for hours at 1kW but over 1kW it disconnects after exactly 1 minute, doesn't matter if it's 1400W or 2100W.

Someone has an idea of what could be the issue? Maybe as there is no communication the charging station expect the charger to do something that in response it doesn't do?

Charger works fine when connect to house 16A 230V outlet, it doesn't has a PFC (power factor correction) so the actual power (active+reactive)that passes from the wires is around 1.5/1.7 times greater, at 2.1kW active around 3.4kW are passing (14.8A @230V).",2024-07-17 21:36:38
1e5t4mb,"What exactly does the eight year powertrain warranty cover?  Does it ensure an EV is in driving condition, software-wise?","The definition from Toyota of the powertrain is:

""The drivetrain consists of the transmission, axles, driveshaft, and differential, as well as the CV joints. The powertrain is composed of all of that PLUS the engine.""

So if we replace 'engine' with battery, would that be a good description of EV powertrain?

My question is simple.  After the factory warranty of three to four years is over but while the powertrain warranty is in force, are the manufacturers forced to put EVs in good driving (drivability) condition?

Just wondering because we've come across a few owner reports of EVs bricking due to software.  If it happens within the first three to give years while the factory warranty is in force, that's not an issue.  But what if it happens after that, would that be covered by the eight year powertrain warranty?

For ICEVs and HEVs, not many software updates so there will not be a he said she said situation when the powertrain fails outside of the warranty period.  For EVs because software and even BMS is critical, just wondering what's the official take and if it's manufacture-specific as to how EVs are put back into drivable condition after a software or non-powertrain related issue ensues.

Thank you.",2024-07-17 20:56:07
1e5swtz,Question - is this normal practice?,"So I was pretty convinced I wanted a Kia, just not sure between full EV or plug-in.  I test drove the Niro and ev6, and niro phev but the battery was dead so only gas. I was going to go back today to drive the Sportage and Niro PHEV and right before coming I said “ please make sure they are charged this time”
He replied  “we don’t charge the EV for anyone unless they’ve already purchased it. nobody who test drives plug-ins cares about testing the EV part. I need special permission from the GM.” Guy also started getting super defensive . This sounded absolutely insane to me. So I called another Kia dealer

They said “all our chargers are broken and the GM doesn’t want to fix them”. I asked “so what about your EV? You’re just not doing test drives anymore if they run out.?” he said “ if you buy it, we will go to a local DC and charge it for you as a courtesy”

1e5kowe,Aptera almost comes clean on pricing.,"[Aptera Costs](https://i.imgur.com/Tt30sPs.png) as presented as part of their fund raise with US Capital Group. As expected the first units will be at significant loss.  Their claim to suddenly become very profitable on  per unit basis is obviously suspect.  The original LE price was around $35,000 so its obvious they are not close and given these Cost of Goods have no direct labor involved they likely have to go higher than here. 
  
Lets look at this way, producing no vehicles is costing them between two and three million per month.  Adding the staff needed to support production not counting the labor needed to produce vehicles is likely to double their costs. Their expected rate is two hundred vehicles a week or eight hundred a month, or just under ten thousand a year assuming one shift. So what they are saying is they will not be profitable as a company for over two years and they already don't have the money to start this production and have a share holder deficit over over two hundred twenty million.

1e5jnp3,What makes Electrify America stations so prone to failure?,"I live in Quebec, Canada. Here most of the charging station are from Circuit Electric, and most of them are quite basic but extremely reliable. For example, they don’t have (or I have not seen one) the option to pay with credit card. You can either tab your Circuit Electric card or use the app to start your session. 

Do you think that the fact that Electrify America stations have credit card modules is what increases their failure rates? I crossed the border last weekend, tried to charge at an Electrify America location and 2 out of the 4 stalls did not work, so I had to wait even if their were only like 4 cars trying to charge.

I can’t recall a single situation where I haven’t been able to make a circuit electric station work.

Im genuinely curious as of why do you think Electrify America stations fail so much ?",2024-07-17 14:31:48
1e5htj7,Travelled across the U.S. for 3200 miles with 3170 lb. cargo  - 2023 Tesla Model Y,"I just got finished with a trip across the U.S. that ended up being about 3200 miles. I carried a trailer that was 1095 lbs. and the cargo was around 1700 lbs. It was me, my significant other, a cat, and road supplies/luggage in the car. A total of around 3170 lbs. The trip did have some detours without the trailer but 98% of it was with the loaded trailer. The journey took us from Pasco, WA (South Central Washington) to Albany, NY.  The car did great pulling that weight with no issues, just had to have a little preplanning for stops each day and extra charging at each charger.

I used the ABRP app to track how much energy was using between charging and overall got the data to calculate other statistics. I had mixed results using ABRP for getting a precise range vs just using the onboard Tesla navigation. Here is my overall experience:

Model: Tesla Model Y - Long Range with factory towing

Total Travel Time: 63 h 43 min

Total Charge Time: 28 h 34 min

Energy Charged: 1583.95 kWh

How I traveled: I only ever went 65 mph, only a handful of times 70 to pass people. My travel averaged 65 mph across the board, used cruise control for the entire trip to maintain consistency. If I went over steeper inclines such as the Rockies in Colorado or Blue Mountains in Oregon, I went max 55 mph. Any faster going up steep inclines you could basically see the percentage click down every couple seconds in percentage.

ABRP app: Did not do a great job at understanding how much charge I needed between charging locations. I changed all of the information in the app including the amount of extra weight I had in the car and towing a trailer.

Tesla Navigation: The navigation did seem to get better after the first couple of charges of the first day of the trip. My first leg of the trip was over Blue Mountains in Oregon. That first leg going over the mountains was a learning curve. The car calculation was negative 27% difference from leaving the charger to the next one in Baker City, OR. After leaving Idaho, the car was often within negative 1 - 8% from the beginning Tesla calculation and the next charger, if on fairly level to slightly hilly terrain. If the terrain was more than just gentle slopes and had steep climbs such as the going over the Rockies, it was about 15 % off.  Overall , I ended up just getting about 10 % more at chargers, depending how far the next one was. That ended up working really well and often times it wasn't necessary especially if I ended up charging to 90% if the car only need 50% and I would kind of  be ""ahead"" for the next couple chargers and had around 20% when I got to the next chargers 4 or 5 chargers.

Power Usage: I will note that the power usage was significant. I once went about 129 miles between charges (the longest) in hilly terrain. I started with 100% and got to the next charger under 11%. I didn't love that. This would have been at a average at 65 mph.

TLDR: Went on a long road trip across the U.S. pulling a trailer with a total weight of 3170 lbs. The Model Y had no problems towing that weight. Just had to drive under the speed limit, maintain consistent speed, and charge roughly 5 - 10% more than the Tesla navigation said, dependent on upcoming terrain.

Right now I've noticed that pretty much any new EV has mostly touch screen controls or touch buttons on the steering wheel.

The new rav4, prius, and accord still have tons of physical buttons on steering wheel and center console. The 2024 prius is also a new design and a hybrid, yet has tons of physical buttons. Even high end german cars like the audi a6 have mostly physical buttons still (except for hvac controls). Why do most mid range-high end EVs have mostly touch screen controls or touch buttons on the steering wheel? They're much harder to use while driving and more distracting.",2024-07-17 06:44:34

1e4zzbz,"Electrify America toasts my car's charging port, refuses to offer anything besides straight repair costs, ignores requests to pick up their cable until I shame them on social media, finally sends a too-small box with a label for a much lighter shipment. Can't believe the ineptitude.","Title text basically says it all, I'm just sharing yet another shitty EA experience. In October 2023, I was driving home from Portland, OR to Seattle with my kiddo after a weekend trip. He had school the next morning, FWIW, but no problem because we were due home by about 2 PM. Stopped to charge at a Walmart about 90 minutes from home while we grabbed lunch. Came back 20 minutes later and couldn't remove the cord from my charging port. It would not budge. No errors on the charger or on my car (Volvo XC40 Recharge full electric). Kept trying. Sat for a bit, tried again. Contacted EA support, who acted like I was an idiot who didn't know how their machines work. 



After 90 minutes of going through multiple tiers of troubleshooting, me insisting they needed to send a tech, they finally dispatch one. Guy arrives about an hour later, tries all the same things, calls out his boss, and they finally agree they need to disassemble the machine to disconnect the cord itself. (These guys were great, BTW, no issue with how they handled this.) That took about another hour. Meanwhile, Volvo roadside assistance dispatched a tow truck, which also took a while to arrive (again, understandable, this was a semi-rural area on a Sunday at 5 PM and we needed a 60-mile tow to the Volvo dealership). Getting the immobile/system-locked car on the truck was a whole other ordeal. 

  
Finally we're on the road around 7:30 PM. Arrive to the dealership around 9. Tow driver and helper go to unload the car and find that the cord has finally loosened in transit. This is when we see the plug had somehow fused with the charging port. WTF; how does that happen? We stash the cord in the car hatch and leave the car in the dealership service yard. Spouse picks us up at 9:15 and we all get home at 10 (again, on a school night for an elemenentary kid). Volvo determined they'd need to fully replace the charging port. As a result, we were without this vehicle for nearly two weeks. I had insurance handle the claim to EA, and to EA's credit, they did reimburse insurance for the repair cost (\~$5k). But literally nothing else. This was an incredibly stressful experience that took 16+ hours of my time (stuck in Walmart lot, dealing with insurance, transport to/from dealership, and communicating the experience to EA itself). They offered absolutely nothing, not even charging credit, which would cost them very little.



Then, to top it off, I ended up stuck with their huge commercial charging cable, including all the connections. They never responded to multiple requests to pick up their cable. Finally just a few weeks ago I see a Reddit repost of an EA tweet about how their cables keep getting stolen in Seattle... so I responded that I have a spare, and proceeded to relay my shitty experience when people asked for more info. Of course this got their attention and they messaged for more info, then said they were sending a pre-labeled shipping box. Still nothing beyond that, but whatever, at least I can get this cable out of my garage, right? Box arrives and it's labeled for 15 lb. (the cord weighs at least 30) and the box is literally single-corrugate (think standard Amazon box) and 24""x16""x8"". Nowhere near large or sturdy enough for the cord. At this point it just feels like a huge prank, and I'm throwing up my hands and about to sell this for $15 to a metal scrapper.

  
And the biggest joke in all this is it's basically impossible to avoid EA chargers when traveling outside of major metro areas in a non-Tesla, so EA still wins.

1e4v97w,Anyone else seen this lease-return scam on portable L2 chargers?,"I recently returned my German EV at lease-end to a dealer in Ottawa Canada (in pristine condition).  Part of the standard equipment was a 9.6Kw portable L2 NEMA 14-50 to J1772 charger.  Naturally, I returned the portable charger with the car when I dropped it off with the dealer.

Lo and behold, 3 months later I get a notification from the financing company that the charger was MISSING from the returned vehicle - at a value of $3,300 CDN.  Conclusion: some low-life had removed the charger - Ebay auction value of \~$500 - and the dealer then automatically tried to bill me via the financing company.

This seems like a risk unique to EVs to me...(?)   Most ICE vehicles dont have fully portable equipment valued at $1000s that sticky fingers can grab. (Do they?)

Beware!  

I could have / should have either: a) paid for a per-dealer inspection service which would document the charger was present, or b) made an inspection video with a dealership employee at time of return.

The heater, the radio, the turn signals (!), and even the regeneration level are handled by a physical control.

You put the car in reverse, the camera comes on. Just like any old car.

Anything to do with navigation or entertainment is handled by CarPlay (or Android if you like that one).

I was looking hard at a Polestar 2 which also has a pretty minimal need to rely on the software, but still read a lot of complaints about the onboard system and updates making the car borderline non-drivable. And the 3 and 4 rely more on software and touch screen, with virtual rearview mirrors etc.

Anyone else just wish these cars weren't giant rolling software / firmware updates? The basics of moving a car with electric motors is not very high tech. And every new car seems to be its own software platform where you have a real fear of being bricked for no good reason.

The one compelling onboard software feature I've read about is something to do with preconditioning the battery prior to arriving at the fast charger. But this has nothing to do with my use case.

1e43iu0,Charging Etiquette in Parking Garage w/ 120v Outlets?,"Last week I leased an EV for the first time (Kia EV6).  I park in a private parking garage where the management doesn't seem to care if people plug in to charge.  There is one 120v outlet on each level and since it's just a regular outlet there is no way to see if someone is done charging.

I've been keeping an eye on the outlets for several months as I contemplated an EV.  Sometimes I will see PHEVs plugged in for 4 or 5 days and fully electric cars plugged in for over a week.  There's one car that doesn't look like it has been moved in months but has the charger plugged in.  I put a bottle cap behind the back tire of another plugged in car to see if it ever moved and so far it hasn't in at least 10 days.

It takes about 2 days for my car to charge from 20% to 90% and within a couple hours of it finishing charging I've gone over to unplug so someone else can use the outlet if needed.

There are limited outlets in the building, so what's the thought on whether or not it's ok to unplug someone else from the 120v outlet if it seems like they've been sitting there for long enough to be fully charged?  Since I would just be unplugging the cord at the outlet to plug my charger in, I wouldn't have to touch their car.

Thanks in advance.",2024-07-15 19:20:16

I wanted to know if anyone in the community has experience with tinkering around with electric vehicles. Is there some kind of database or website where I can get information about car batteries and battery packs for each electric vehicle model?

The website should have information about capacity, amperage, voltage, etc. Maybe to give old car batteries a second life, but for that, I would need much more technical information. It would be great if there was a website like [EV Database](https://ev-database.org/de/) for car battery details.

1e418wo,CCS DC Fast Charging Network is absolute trash,"Took a road trip for the first time to Vegas in our new Blazer EV. We have a Tesla Model 3 we usually take. I have to say, I’ve wasted so much time looking for a CCS charger than I have ever with my Tesla combined. There’s about 10 stations in Vegas. Each with 4-6. They were all full most of the time with 4-6 people waiting. You know what was sometimes across the street? A Tesla Supercharger with 20 chargers. I’ve been to Vegas around 10 times with my Tesla. Never had to drive or look for another spot. 

I think it’s ridiculous that a destination spot has 40-60 chargers all spread out for all of the EVs. It’s probably not even enough for locals. 

Edit: This is also not a Tesla vs rest debate. It’s Supercharger vs CCS network. I want my next EV to be an Ioniq5 but this might make me second guess things until everyone fully switches.",2024-07-15 17:50:32
1e410sn,"Questions about charger 200amp, calculations if off peak savings worth?","2nd EDIT: Got home from work and to my very pleasant surprise my house already had a 200AMP, was not expecting that but makes my life a lot easier now.

EDIT: thanks for the help in the math, should be 250 / 3.2 kWh = 78 kWh per week * 4 weeks * 12 months = 3,750 kwh per year * $0.0650 savings off peak rate = $246 in savings a year. So seems paying to get upgrades to 200 amp would not be worth it, if rates didn’t change in 10 years would only save $2,460 and likely installation costs would be higher than that.


I am buying a Hyundai Ioniq 5 2024 Limited this week and making calls to Electricians to get quotes for installing the charger. 

Per reddit recommendations was probably going to buy a Grizzl-E charger.

  
I am in Minnesota, USA.

Getting mixed messages from the Electricians on what is worth it to do.  I thought 200 amp was required to charge at level 2 at home, but seems only required to get discounted rate and can charge without at level 2 still. Can Grizzl-E work on 100 amp?

  
My utility company offers off peak hour discounted rate of $0.057/kWh if you qualify by getting all the additional installations which include  200 amp, additional electrical panel and socket for second monitor outside. I've heard on reddit and one electrician  told me already that it costs about $4K for this work, saw one isolated report of it being as low as $2K if you shop around, but lets go with at least $4K cost.

Checking my latest bill they charged for 684 KWH @ $0.1226 for $83.86 plus a PCA charge on the same 684 KWH of 0.0150 for $10.26

The last electrician I spoke with was indicating its probably not worth it going to the 200 amp and just to stay on whatever I currently have, I don't know what is, but probably 100 or 150.

Commute to work and back 44 miles a day x4 a week, counting weekends lets estimate 250 miles a week. Saw something about 4 KWH per mile so is the math as easy as 250 miles x 4 KWH = 1,000 KWH a week to charge? x4 weeks = 4,000 a month or 12 months = 48,000 a year? 

No idea if my math is on track or going way of course here? I think I am way too high. A fast Google says average EV is only 4,310, so seems I may be carrying an extra decimal here. 

  
If its 48,000 KWH a year, normal rate $0.1226 per KWH minus peak rate of $0.057 = difference of $0.0656 x 48,000 KWH = $3,148.80 USD in savings if getting the off peak hour discount, if it cost me $4K to install, almost pays for itself in the first year, definitely would in the second year. 

  
If its 4,800 KWH per year x $0.0656 = only $314.88 savings per year, in 10 years it won't have paid for itself.

1e3wpon,MG4 First Impression,"Thought I'd give my 2 cents on my first thoughts. 
I'm in no way a great reviewer!

Space: 
It's larger than I thought it'd be. Plenty of space and easy to put the back seets down. 
As a 6 ft 2 guy, plenty of room in the front (the steering wheel could be a little higher than what it can be adjusted to) 

The back seats don't have a lot of room and it is a little snug behind the drivers seat when pushed back to my personal position.
Behind the passenger there's a lot more room (of course) so take that as you will.

Driving: 

Driving is very smooth, also coming from a manual polo it accelerates very quick and steering/cornering feels great!

Not as smooth suspension wise, it's decent but nothing special. 

System/features:
Sensors worked accurately to display other vehicles on the road.

Sound system is mediocre which is fine. Would be nicer with surround sound but pretty sure there's only 2 front speakers

It can be difficult to navigate the UI at first so takes a while to find everything you need. you'll likely spend a couple hours finding your feet

App:
Using the app and charging, setting the temperature and lock/start charge works fine so far. It did fail the first time but I think I hadn't put it in properly as it also failed when attempted to start charge while sitting in the car. 


Faults: 

It did come with a faulty airbag light which is fairly annoying. 

Some had mentioned issues with dents underneath the vehicle on the metal sheet covering the bottom which mine does have a minor dent which I will mention. 

There is also a bubble on the dashboard which you'll only notice when checking for it. 
Yet to get full use of lane assist and other safe driving features but will keep updated. 

Overall pretty impressed. Just needs that bit of polishing but great for price

1e3ven7,Does anyone else feel like Plugshare has regressed?,"Sometime in the last year or so, Plugshare removed the filtering for Tesla (Fast) and Tesla (L2), and combined them into simply 'NACS'. What is the logic for this change? When I'm looking for a charger, there is essentially no crossover in what I'm looking for; I either want a fast charger or a slow charger, not both. The point of filters is to be able to clean up the map, and now when I'm looking for a charger or planning a route, I'm stuck looking at orange pins, surrounded by a bunch of useless green pins (or vice-versa).

To add to the confusion, Plugshare lists **ALL** Tesla Superchargers under the same filter, which means V2 chargers get lumped in with V3/V4. As someone who now drives a vehicle with CCS (in addition to a Model 3), it's really misleading to see V2 Superchargers show up, which ARE NOT COMPATIBLE or open to CCS vehicles (even with an adapter).

For the GM employees who may be getting an EV as company car, they are ""Strongly Encouraged"" to use QMerit for their charger installation, although not mandatory.

1e3sp9t,Corsa E - charging at home?,"Hi, got a Corsa E around 6 weeks ago and have recently moved in to a new home, where I wanted to charge it. In the meantime I’ve just been charging it at public charge points

I bought an iON tech charger and my Dad fitted it, it does charge etc when doing it manually, however the app is terrible and the scheduling doesn’t work. I wanted to charge it between 12AM-5AM when my British Gas rates are low. Even the Vauxhall app schedule doesn’t work as the charger disconnects as it thinks it’s switched off if it’s not charging for 3+ mins.

I’m not eligible for the Octopus EV charging tariff as the Corsa E isn’t on the list, feeling a bit dejected with the car and the thought of having to stay up to midnight just to charge it.

Does anyone have a charger at home using the Corsa E and are happy with it, one they can schedule? Admittedly the one I bought was quite cheap but before buying another I’d like to know that the scheduling feature does work well with the Corsa E as the scheduling is most important to me.

1e3b80j,I do t understand the fuss about ev car weight ,"I'm either missing some information or not fully understanding something about EV tires. When I signed my Polestar lease, I was offered insurance that covers all tire and rim damage, costing over $1,000 extra. The salesperson explained that since the car is an EV, it's very heavy, and driving over potholes could damage the rims and cause flats more quickly than with a regular sedan.

I did some quick research to see if this was just a sales tactic or if I actually needed the insurance. I found out that EVs are indeed heavier than the average sedan. However, there are many cars, like the BMW M5, that weigh even more than the Polestar 2 (which weighs between 4,400-4,600 lbs). The BMW M5, for instance, weighs around 5,400 lbs and has 200 lb-ft more torque than the Polestar 2.

So, why do EVs need special tires, and why was I told that everyone keeps damaging rims and getting flats because of the car's weight? Everything I find online just says that EVs are different because they are heavy and have high torque, but no one seems to explain why they are different from other heavy cars.

1e39uyr,Fast charging with a Tesla is hands down the best.,"Edit: Maybe it didn't come across. I was trying to focus on the ease and reliability of charging with a Tesla. Not necessarily the speed, e.g the Bolt.

We have a Chevy Bolt for around town and a Ford Lightning for truck stuff. Both cars are amazing, and we've loved the savings from the Bolt for three years now. I've taken the bolt on wire a few trips to New York City about 400 miles away. With the charging limitations, I've just planned ahead, taken my time, and just made it work.  Well, we recently rented an older '16 Model X 75d to drive cross country and back (we needed at least six seats). What a huge difference the charging experience is, even on this older model!!!  It still has free super charging so that was even more pleasant. The Tesla was just so easy. Just park, grab the charger, push the button, and plug it in. No messing with a billion different apps, all with their own reserve wallet and separate logins, credit card info, etc. And every Supercharger worked. That's definitely not the case for Electrify America, EV connect, EVGo, public charging, etc. I didn't like the route it took us on (it took us through some tolls even though the setting was for no tolls, and a much longer route). But I did love how the routing told us the arrival percent and how long to charge to get to the next charger. Being older, it didn't have the best of charging curves, taking sometimes 50 minutes. But it was usually just right for a bathroom break and time for the kids to get wiggles out. More range also would have been nice. But hands down, the ease and simplicity was way better than a non-Tesla! As far as charging. Driving across Wyoming wasn't the best with so few options on 80, but the higher speed limit made up for it, 😁.",2024-07-14 18:50:27
1e39f5a,Rented an Ioniq 5 ... And I don't get it.,"I've had a Tesla model 3 since 2018. I rented the cheapest rental car and they were out of everything other than an Ioniq 5, for which I got a free upgrade.

I was excited because that car is often recommended over the Tesla model Y here, and I was really looking forward to driving it. After a three day weekend, I truly don't get the allure.

To start, the car feels solid. I'll give it that. It certainly doesn't seem high end, but everything has a heavy feel which I guess is a good thing. Like all EVs, it drives very smoothly and accelerates well. 

Neither of those seemed to be better than Teslas, but definitely not worse. But I honestly can't figure out why anyone would buy this over a model Y.

First, for all the love of physical buttons, there's still a lot of reliance on the infotainment screen, and it isn't exactly intuitive whether something is effected through buttons or the screen. Ditto for the start/stop. That said, like any car, I'm sure you get used to it, so that's a push. 


Next, I couldn't believe how much the estimated range was reduced by the air conditioner. Maybe it doesn't actually result in such a drastic change, but experience in my car is that the actual wh/mile in my car is hardly changed by AC use.

But I just couldn't get past the lane-keep/TACC. It's really dangerous how bad it is at telling you whether the activation was successful or not, and ditto with a deactivation.  That's especially true given that it's probably most important to activate it when you need to interact with a menu on the infotainment. I would say it's clearly less capable than my M3 basic autopilot was back in 2018, and certainly less so than it is in 2024 legacy Autosteer, let alone FSD.

I'm not exactly a Tesla fanboi, but I have to say given the similar pricing, I have a hard time understanding why anyone would choose the Ioniq 5.",2024-07-14 18:32:13

1e34jzq,How much do you think rising heat levels might increase the portion of EVs sold that are white or light colored in the long-term?,"It's pretty well established that light colors are better at reflecting sunlight and dark colors are better at absorbing sunlight. So white cars are normally ideal for warmer, sunny climates and vice versa for black cars in colder, cloudy climates.

https://www.motorbiscuit.com/scientific-reason-white-1-most-popular-car-color/

I'm curious to see how that relationship might affect consumer preferences in their car purchases, especially with EVs, as we learn to adapt to the increasing heatwaves that accompany a changing climate. White exteriors seem increasingly attractive in that regard to help better manage AC usage and driving range. Maybe manufacturers and dealerships reduce the exterior color options available to focus on a more limited light color assortment to better match that shifting demand.

 I'm curious how others here were thinking about those potential trends.",2024-07-14 15:08:32

1e31dcj,Hertz Tesla Sale is Basically Over,"As folks here know, Hertz bought a lot of Teslas and then a few years later decided to sell them. Hertz is one of the largest US used car sellers and it is part of their business to sell their used cars after they reach a certain amount of age or mileage (and sometimes just to make a profit when the used market is good for a certain make and model). So they are always selling cars of a ton of different manufacturers. Right now their site says they have 27,000 cars for sale. But only 56 of them are Teslas. For a long time that number was between 800 or 1,000. So it seems that Hertz has basically made it through most of their inventory. So the huge Hertz Tesla sale seems to be over.

Anyway, I think the Hertz Tesla sale was large enough for long enough that it had an impact on the used EV market. There were arguably some very good deals to be had. So worth a note that this thing that was happening seems to be done.",2024-07-14 12:42:10

I am currently renting a mach-e and it has to be returned to Avis with a 95% full battery. However, at public chargers the speed slows way down to like 3kw after 80%, plus there's usually like a 1 hour limit anyway. Does anyone have advice on how to get the stupid thing to a full charge so I can return it to the rental place without a huge fuel fee? Would it be better to use a level 2 somewhere?  (Obviously I do not have any access to home charging) 

Eta: some commenters have pointed out that the employee may not have been fully informed and that the Avis website says I only have to return it at 70%. I'll check my rental agreement tomorrow to be sure! 

Eta 2: Verified my rental agreement, the attendant hand wrote ""95%"" at the top of the first page. The second page however is the EV ammendment to the rental which specifies 70% upon return, so I think the person I dealt with was just uninformed.

1e2luvg,Public Charging and usage,"Like a lot of people, I’m thinking my next car is going to be an EV. My one hesitation is that my condo does not have a charging station available- and even if we did, it wouldn’t be dedicated. My question to this group is around the need to charge/frequency.

My city has a good amount of level 2 chargers available (charge point), so charging is available, but would take 8 hours or whatever and would be through the company. The thing is, I work from home, and basically use my car average 2 times a week, for maybe 30 -60 miles? Obviously that’s variable. So I know no one knows the exact answer, but realistically, with today’s batteries and ranges and stuff, how often would I need to charge? I feel like I’m used to people talking about charging daily, but I’m unclear if that’s just for the ranges they need or just bc obviously the battery is losing charge just sitting there. 

Any advice? Or anecdotal information?

I was hoping to 'trickle charge' my Audi e-tron with the 120v adapter I have in order to not tax our generator too much, but I am facing a big obstacle: Every time our AC turns on which is about every 10 minutes, it causes a small power blip and dims all the lights for a split second as the generator briefly reduces RPM from the AC load. This power fluctuation is apparently enough to cause the charge cable (the one that came with the Audi) to stop charging and I would have to manually reset charging each time. Tried it with the 50A plug at 50% speed and it does the same thing. I can of course charge at charging stations and have done so this week, but this is Houston we're talking about and the ones that do work are few and far in between.

Is there setting or something I can use to bypass this issue so the car charges without interruption and we still have AC?

I think there are only two legitimate reasons why EVs might cause concern for buyers:

1. Street parking / Apartment Parking

Most of the time they can't granny charge overnight and are reliant on charger networks. Some of them can depending on the area, but I'd wager at this time the infrastructure isnt in their favour

2. Flat tyres

I know Tesla has a complimentary tow service, but if you're outside a 50km tow zone they won't cover it. You can't change your own tyre because of potential damage to battery pack and maybe something to do with with tyre software connection to notify of any changes to tyre integrity.

1e1ajug,Please understand - Peak charging rate is a poor metric for judging charging speeds! ,"Hello fellow EV enthusiasts,

I wanted to share some insights based on my experience with the 2023 Nissan Ariya, particularly concerning the misconceptions around peak charging rates and actual charging speeds.

I drive a 2023 Nissan Ariya with the larger 87kWh battery pack. While it often gets criticized for its ""low"" peak charging rate of 136kW, the reality is quite different. Thanks to its efficient charging curve, the Ariya actually outperforms many EVs with higher peak charging rates. Here’s why:

# 2023 Nissan Ariya's (87kWh) Real-World Charging Performance

**Peak Charging Rate**: 136kW

**Charging Curve**: Achieves 136kW up to 44% State of Charge (SOC), then gradually tapers off

* By 44% SOC: Maintains 136kW. [(Source)](https://i.redd.it/z9m9mteow0cd1.jpeg)
* By 80% SOC: Falls to 82kW.

**10% to 80% Charging Time**: 31 minutes and 44 seconds. ([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/NissanAriya/comments/1dtcxa1/32_minutes_to_charge_from_9_to_80/#lightbox))

**Average Charging Speed (10% to 80%)**: 107kW.

**Public Perception**: Lackluster charging speeds.

# 2024 Tesla Model 3 Long Range (82kWh) Real-World Charging Performance

**Peak Charging Rate**: 250kW

**Charging Curve**:

* By 44% SOC: Drops to 121kW.
* By 80% SOC: Falls to 45kW.

**10% to 80% Charging Time**: 32 minutes. [(Source)](https://evkx.net/models/tesla/model_3/model_3_long_range/chargingcurve/)

**Average Charging Speed (10% to 80%)**: 97kW.

**Public Perception**: Rarely criticized for charging speeds.

# Polestar 2 (2021-2023) (78kWh) and Volvo XC40/C40 Dual Motor

* **Peak Charging Rate**: 155kW

**Charging Curve**:

* By 44% SOC: Drops to 84kW.
* By 80% SOC: Falls to 54kW.

**10% to 80% Charging Time**: 36 minutes. [(Source)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amWtmGGt8GQ&t=391s)

**Public Perception**: Rarely criticized for charging speeds and seen as a viable alternative to Tesla.

# 2023 Ford Mustang Mach-E Long Range RWD (92kWh)

* **Peak Charging Rate**: 150kW

**Charging Curve**:

* By 44% SOC: Drops to 96kW.
* By 80% SOC: Falls to 12kW.

**10% to 80% Charging Time**: 44 minutes and 58 seconds. [(Source)](https://evkx.net/models/ford/mustang_mach-e/mustang_mach-e_long_range_rwd/chargingcurve/)

**Average Charging Speed (10% to 80%)**: 86kW.

**Public Perception**: Known to be a slower charging vehicle but seen as a viable alternative to Tesla.

# Conclusion

Peak charging rate is often used as a headline figure to judge an EV's charging capabilities, but it doesn’t tell the whole story. The charging curve and sustained charging speeds are what truly matter in real-world conditions.

The Nissan Ariya, despite its seemingly modest peak rate, delivers excellent overall charging performance, often better than its higher-peak counterparts. When evaluating EVs, it's crucial to look beyond peak numbers and consider how they perform throughout the entire charging session.

1e0k33m,Some questions regarding Level 1 charging for a first time owner!,"Hello, long time member, first time EV owner (soon).

I will be picking up my 2024 ID4 today with the 82kWh battery, and currently don't have any charger at home. The salesperson informed me that I could charge overnight using the included charger and a simple 120V wall outlet, and top off at a level 2 or 3 charger elsewhere (many of those where I live luckily).

I heard going from 10-80% on the id4 on level one could take 14-18 hours, so I plan on charging for 7-10 hours overnight, and then toping off when needed at other level 2 & 3 chargers. ***Does this seem like a viable strategy?***

The second question was whether this would be viable in an older house. I understand that level 1 draws around the same amount of power as a very power hungry appliance like a hair dryer or toaster oven. ***My question is though, should I expect the breaker to trip constantly from the constant high voltage draw?*** My preliminary research indicates that in an older house (1986 to be precise), this could be an issue. From what I am aware, there is no other power draw coming from the garage outlets breaker.

Lastly, ***is it possible to use an extension cord like*** [***this***](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/hdx-50-ft-16-gauge-13-amps-indoor-outdoor-light-duty-extension-cord-orange/1000111066) ***to extend the length of my level 1 charger?*** The outlet in the garage is 15 ft away (I live in a home built built by an elderly boat mechanic hence the large garage), and will need to be snaking around another large F-150 truck. Could this be a fire hazard due to the high heat?

Thank you for all your replies. Really excited to get an EV (already have all the apps set up), but just wanted to make sure about everything. In my old ICE car I would go to a station, get 87, and call it a day, so sorry for my ignorance regarding this topic.",2024-07-11 08:41:25

1e0gnc2,Why EVs are failing in the US and why I won't be getting another one,"The first year (2022-2023) I had my 2023 Volvo C40, everything was great. I went on a few 5-6 hour road trips and never really had any issues.

OK, that's not true--one time, I had a couple come up to me and complain that I was using an EA charger that had CHAdeMO. It was the only charger offering CHAdeMO, but the only other charger open wasn't working. So they're being passive aggressive, telling me I should've just called EA if the other charger isn't working.  
  
*Yeah, you may have places to be, but you should've thought about that before getting an EV.*

The past year has been terrible. Starting the winter of 2023, I've noticed more and more chargers failing. Freewire chargers are going out left and right, barely being open for a week at a time. In a major US metro area, I went to an EA station and half of the chargers were completely inoperable. Everyone else there charging was pulling 30-70kw.

Opening up Tesla's network will help, but they're going to fill up with all of the people fleeing the rest of our failing charging infrastructure.

My theory is--there seems to be quite a bit of infrastructure bill money to build new chargers, but not a lot of that funding is allocated for maintaining them. I imagine (and I don't know this for sure) that the government is expecting these companies to eventually become profitable and rely on the maintenance themselves.

Well for whatever reason, these companies aren't maintaining their infrastructure. My theory is--the US is simply too spread out to enable charging fees to offset the costs of maintenance, and charging infrastructure should be focused only in metro areas. I imagined all of the high-volage equipment relies on very skilled people and very expensive parts.

Luckily, I leased my EV, so I don't have to deal with getting rid of it. No, EVs are not a silver bullet to solving our environmental and transportation needs. We should've put more money into hybrids. With all the billions we spent, we would've taken more greenhouse gases out of the air just doing a cash for clunkers program that required people to get a hybrid to get the credit.

tl;dr the EV charging infrastructure in the US is failing, and I won't be getting another one in the near future.",2024-07-11 04:49:47

1e0debs,US EV trade tariffs on Chinese cars. Good or Bad or Ugly!? ,"I love the US car brands that are making EV's and I want them to succeed. 

However, Chinese EV's are high quality too and their car companies like Xpeng and BYD cost less than 50% of the price of US cars. 

The Xpeng G6 is the premium model Y competitor and is as low as 21K USD for entry level and 35K USD for premium without the tariffs. Some other models are as low as 15K USD. 

So many low and middle-income Americans who need a car to have a job would benefit greatly by having the option to buy Chinese cars. 

My thinking is rather than have a trade war with China, why not allow these cars to be sold in the US so that low income citizens especially would benefit hugely from this. 

This might also allow US car makers to accelerate their own transition to EV's and make affordable EV's faster rather than operating in a bubble of their own. 

They have to anyway compete all over the world, and having Tariffs only in the US and some EU countries doesn't really solve anything. Rather than have a traditional ""We are afraid of China power and need to stop them"" approach, some level of co-operation and free market open trade policy would be more beneficial for both countries.",2024-07-11 01:54:38

1e07or3,"EVs as a home battery backup. Why do some systems require an inverter, while some don't? ","Q - Why do some EV-as-homeBattery (EVHB) require an external inverter while some don't?
A - Because some EVs output DC directly from their chsrgeport (GM's announced system) while some EV's output AC directly from their chsrgeport (Ford's system).

Q - What's the reason for that?
A - You either have to use a separate onboard inverter to output AC power (which although the Silverado EV and F150 Lightning both have, only the lightning uses it in home battery mode) or use your motor inverters or your On-Board AC-DC charger in reverse to be able to NOT NEED an external inverter.

Q - Why do some companies do it and some don't?
A - Some EV's don't have very powerful onboard chargers, while most motor inverters aren't designed and the vehicle system isn't designed for the motor inverter use as a stationary inverter.

Q - What's the differences in systems needing an external inverter and systems not needing an external inverters?
A - For systems needing an external inverters, you can attach stationary home batteries, thread in solar panels, and then also attach your EV as a backup, while systems not needing an external inverter cannot do that.

Q - Is there a list of vehicles available that are suitable for use as home battery backup, but differentiated by while ones require external inverters and which don't? (This is important as the difference can be in tens of thousands of dollars).
A - I'm hoping people here will fill this one out.

Q - How much power can these EVs output?
A - They have different ratings, better to check user manuals or ask on their respective forums. Usually the ceiling is going to be around 10kW for systems, whether they need or don't need an external inverter. Your home can power it's heat pump, dryer, microwave, electric oven and the AC, on this 10kW of power, but NOT ALL TOGETHER. Always best to design the electrical system such that not everything is hooked to be powered up on your EV battery as a backup.

Q - Add in your questions and answers if you know, and I'll pick up stuff and keep adding it here.

1dztzsu,New US and Canadian CCS chargers in June 2024,"**Here are all (\*) of the new US and Canadian CCS (Level 3 fast-charging) stations that rolled out in June 2024,** according to the Department of Energy. You can [get the data yourself here](https://afdc.energy.gov/data_download).

These chargers are suitable for most new EVs on the market, except for:

1. Tesla drivers who haven't bought the official CCS adapter yet. Certain older Teslas need additional work done to accept the adapter.
2. Nissan Leaf owners, owners of the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, and some owners of older cars that also use CHAdeMO. If you drive such a car, see my matching post in r/leaf.

**Some of these chargepoints will be ""refreshes,""** e.g. the provider replaced them with faster chargers etc. Some may be incorrect. This report is only as good as the Alternative Fuels Data Center data.

**There were 216 CCS charging stations with a total of 517 chargepoints added or refreshed in June 2024.** For comparison, there were 304 new CCS charging stations in June 2023, with 899 chargepoints.  However, June 2023 was an exceptional month. Overall the trend seems pretty flat right now.

Some of these stations are likely to be Tesla Magic Dock stations. Previously Tesla didn't report these to the AFDC as CCS, but now they do. And that makes sense because all CCS drivers can use them.

**NOTE:** most Tesla Superchargers do NOT have magic dock as of this writing (all those shown in this report should have it). I recommend using PlugShare to locate compatible stations for your vehicle.

**(\*) ""What about other Tesla Superchargers? Can't everybody charge with NACS now?""**

It's coming for many makes and models, and for newer Ford models as well as a few other manufacturers charging at v3 and v4 Superchargers is already an option with a free adapter from the automakers. GM should release their adapter this year. But since they are not open to *all* CCS vehicles, this report is not the place for non-Magic-Dock superchargers. If you are interested Tesla's app provides the best guide to their locations, including locations that work with certain non-Tesla vehicles.

**Other Notes**

To streamline this post, multi-chargepoint locations are listed with the number of chargepoints first.

For serious trip planning, I recommend PlugShare. But by all means check out these reported new locations and submit reviews on PlugShare, which makes things better for everyone.

If you'd like to know about new chargers along your routes right away, or just prefer not to check this list monthly when new openings are rare in your area, I've set up a free service that provides email notifications as soon as they open. You can [sign up at evpov.com](https://evpov.com/). Or not! I don't really have a business plan here, I built it to help EV owners like myself. PlugShare has a similar feature.

I would like to know about things that can help you travel. For instance, imagine the situation: you're going to a place out of your range, and there are no chargers along the route, like none. Would you even take that route with your EV? Can you reduce your speed to get a more extended range in this one? Or are there any other tricks you can use to save the battery and get to that ""out of range"" destination?",2024-07-10 09:47:20

Charging at home with BC Hydro is $0.1034 per kWh
A 2015 LEAF holds 24kWhs of electrons and goes 150kms on them.
24 x .1034 = $2.4816 to fully charge
2.4816 to go 150km is $0.016544 per km of travel, right?

A Maverick Hybrid uses 5.8L of fuel to go 100kms
If Guzzolene is $2.25 a Liter that's $13.05 per 100kms
Or $0.1305 per km of travel.

Guzzolene has come back down under $2 a liter now, I had first done this math when it was nearer to $2.25. Even at $1.75 there’s still going to be a huge price per km different if I have this math right.",2024-07-10 03:11:36

I have a window ac, tv, internet, lights, fridge, and freezer being powered by my 1200w solar & EV6 into a solar generator with transfer switch. These devices average 800w during the day and 300w at night when sleeping. The solar covers me during the day, and the EV6 covers me at night (on day two and at 85%).

Many gas stations in Houston are either closed (no power) or have long lines. I just drove around and saw people scrambling to find gas to refill their generators and vehicles. Meanwhile, my EV has allowed me to keep my family comfortable, fed, and not stressed. V2L is something manufacturers should add to every EV going forward. It's incredibly useful and works perfect.

Edit 7/10/2024: Still no power and the EV6 continues to perform flawlessly. Car was at 71% and even though I could have lasted several more days before recharging... I found an open fast charger so was able to quickly top off. We're still surviving off V2L three days now.

Edit 7/15/2024: We got power back yesterday. My power consumption actually ended up increasing because I decided to run my security server and POE cameras as well (there were rumors of breakins at night). I burned about 20% of charge a day because we also had very little sun. My V2L worked great because I was able to recharge elsewhere and bring power back to the house. My plan for next time is to double my solar so I get better performance on less sunny days. Overall, I'm extremely happy with how my setup performed!",2024-07-10 01:46:10

i have a hyundai ioniq with free 30 minutes of charging, so i try not to go over that. however after my last charge i received an email that said i was charged money because i charged for 54 minutes. 

that’s just wrong. i was only there for 25 minutes. when i look at the time it said i was charging, it said i was there between 4-5. however, i left the charger by 3:30. i remember because i sent a text as i was leaving that said i’m on my way home, and that text was sent at 3:30. 

looking back, the charger was quite glitchy. the touch screen was very unresponsive, and the only way i could end the charge was by pulling the charger out of my car. it never gave me an on screen confirmation of my charging session like it usually does because it seemed to have been lagging, possibly due to the high heat. 

i called their support like but they were useless. they just said that if the machine said i was there for 54 minutes there was nothing they could do about it. 

overall a pretty bad experience. it’s still cheaper than having to use another charger because of my 30 min free plan, but it sucks that i was charged for time i didn’t use.

1dz6v2m,I consider myself a car guy and I find myself doing some things differently with my first EV at the age of 44,"Ever since I can remember I have loved cars. All vehicles. I was subscribed to road and track and car and driver and motor trend. Since I was a wee little kid and read them back to front. I knew everything about any new model and different trims.

I've never had a car collection or had vehicles that are rare or supercars but I just love driving them. I love looking at them. I love talking about them and I could talk about them for hours. 

Bought my first EV last year. A lightning and I'm absolutely head over heels over it everyday I get in. I just love everything about how it drives. I love the complete quietness. I love the instant power, the lack of revving and having to build power .

A few things that I find myself doing differently now that I own an EV. I wash my car more frequently and I'm not talking about just running it through a gas station xar wash tunnel I'm talking about like deep cleaning inside. Cleaning the inside the windows wiping things down. I'm doing that fairly often. Definitely more often than when I owned an ice vehicle.

I find myself going on slow drives just cruising. Just driving around the neighborhood. Enjoying the complete silence. Windows down. Cool air coming through. It just feels amazing and I'd love the peace it brings.

I surprisingly am not missing going to a gas station. I didn't think it was going to be much of a big deal but it's nice not going to a gas station.

I find myself more so nowadays thinking ice is just archaic. The smell of gas and Diesel and oil is just unnecessary and I don't enjoy it. It didn't bother me before but now it just seems like caveman times.

I know this sub is going crap all over me for having a large truck and that I run over people and I'm the worst for owning one but I love that I can drive a truck that's efficient. I'm in a small Idaho town and a truck is very handy to have and I've always wanted one but felt guilty with wasting gas. Now it feels like I get best of both worlds.",2024-07-09 16:32:36

My issue is with existing charging infrastructure problems. We took the car on a road trip for the first time a couple of weeks ago and it really highlighted these issues. Normally, I have a charger at home and can top the battery off here and charge at EA when I'm in EA territory or drive to it when battery is very low.

That being said, being on the road meant I didn't have a routine. I just needed to charge the thing; free, paid, I didn't care. My hotel had an EVGo and EA close by.

EVGo had about 6 chargers in total. 2-3 were always broken during this trip. EA had 4 chargers and one was down, the other one charged slowly (suspected issue with cable cooling), others were busy, etc. It really started to piss me off, especially when I thought about the experience of just putting gas/diesel **anywhere**. I started to think that I dedicate too much of my life to thinking about these damn charging stations. 

Where are they? How many are down? How many people are charging/waiting? Will some asshole cut in line? What if they do? Is a Bolt charging at 12 kWh using a 150 kWh rated charger? Will the machine recognize my car and give me free charging? It doesn't more than I'd like to admit. What if I want to drive down to Mexico? Where can I charge there? Why are we all driving $90K+ cars and congregating at this place to save $12?

And this is where I am today. Seriously considering getting out of this EQS at a great financial loss and get something like the Blazer for commuting and a larger ICE SUV/Truck for road trips. I don't understand why we cannot have reliable charging stations and why there are always some that are broken.

Here's a BIOS image of an EVGO charger which obviously wasn't working; for your time reading my rant.

UPDATE 2024/07/12:

Rivian towed the vehicle from my house and set up a rental car for me. Signed paperwork that listed 10 issues to be repaired

UPDATE 2024/07/10:

I haven't get any called yet so I made 2 online chats starting from 2pm ish:

The rep told me I will be contacted in 30 minutes from Bellevue Center.
Waiting for an hour, no calls are coming in, so I made a scond chat with them. This counts as a second time rivian broke their promises.

2. The rep had zero context on the appointments and tried to tell me go to new Seattle service center. After a lot of back and forth, he finally scheduled a tow to Bellevue service center this Friday 9 am and told me there will be 3-4 weeks(or more) for the wait . Afterwards, leadership called me, reassuring tow is coming.

In the meantime, I am contacting legal service for my case.


==========

TLDR: I have 10+ issues(1 outstanding safety concern that limit my speed suddenly) with my new R1S in the less than two weeks ownership and I have trouble scheduling an appointment with them. Today I drove it to the service center and in the end I was told:

1. We don’t have return policy for leasing.

2. Your safety concern has been escalated. We will investigate it from logs remotely. You will hear from us by the end of this week.

3. You have to drive your vehicle home today without any inspection.


I am a new EV owner and I know there can be more issues with EV since it is just a giant computer. I wonder if my experience is normal compared with other manufacturers.

In addition, I know it maybe a little early to talk about lemon law. After seeing the messy service and protocol from rivian, I just can’t trust them will fix all of the issues. And when I look at the terms of WA lemon laws, the vehicle seems should be repaired several times. But how can I count these numbers and out of order time if they refuse to keep it in the service center?I even don’t know the visit today counts in as a repair attempt.",2024-07-09 02:17:04

First miss, the hotel valet (a somewhat high end luxury hotel \~$400+ per night) offers free EV charging but was unsure about this particular model and couldn't say over the phone whether they'd definitely be able to charge it like they did the Model 3 on the past trip. My mom is not aware of the specific plug standard/type/adapters/whatever technical information is required to know how this vehicle receives power.

Her flight lands, she gets to the rental spot and tries to type in the name of her hotel into the vehicle's navigation, a 45-minute drive away. She calls me and says she cannot figure out how to type a space on the built-in navigation. The keyboard UI is laid out in an odd way and they use a horizontal bracket icon for space and she just didn't quite click with that to the point where she understood that to be the spacebar. Once she got that, typing in the name of the hotel brought up hotels 2,500 miles away in Chicago, but not the hotel in LA that's been around for decades and was less than 50 miles away. It just wouldn't take it by name and required a street name/city/state/zip manual entry.

I told her to stop mucking around with the poor Hyundai-made nav and connect via Bluetooth to get wireless CarPlay going. After a few minutes figuring out how to connect - Nope. The car doesn't have wireless CarPlay at all in 2024. So I had her dig around in her luggage for a USB cable to connect directly to enable wired CarPlay. Nope, this 2024 vehicle only has USB-A ports with not a single USB-C to be found in the entire vehicle, and she doesn't have a dongle on her. Her iPhone 12 Pro from 4 years ago came with a USB-C cable and that's what she uses with her iMac from 4 years ago and her two computers from 4 and 7 years ago. How could a new EV not have USB-C or wireless CarPlay? My 2018 Jeep Wrangler has four USB-C ports.

I dreaded having to walk her through Electrify America or setting up a Tesla account for third party Supercharging of a rental vehicle. She ended up switching to a Model 3 before ever leaving the lot, saving a ton on rental costs and knew exactly how to operate the Tesla UI, get her destination added and was on her way in minutes.

Just an anecdote about the state of non-Tesla EVs and how easy it is to trip up the average consumer. Tesla does UI/UX and the end-to-end experience so well and it means more than you'd think to an average consumer. I wish the overall landscape was more standardized and the access to superchargers does a whole lot, but it's just wild what other manufacturers feel they can get away with in terms of software and the overall experience. Rivian is there, Tesla is there, everyone else feels Stone Age.

Is there any other EV out there that's on the level of Rivian and Tesla like this, or is it all just a mish mash of poorly thought out software like it is with ICE vehicles?",2024-07-08 17:25:19

But if someone does 2-3 year leases, would that mean they net no benefit, or a minor one (especially if they don't drive a lot), because they haven't accumulated enough driving without fuel use to offset the original manufacturing environmental costs, and then keep adding to that eco-debt by getting a new vehicle ever 2-3 years?",2024-07-08 12:26:42

1dxu1qf,New US fuel economy rules biased towards ICE vehicles.,"The upcoming changes to the US CAFE fuel economy rules is adjusting the values used to assess EV mileage for the purpose of awarding credits and penalties.  The changes are intended to give more realistic estimates of fossil fuel use compared to the old method.

[https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/10-cfr-part-474-petroleum-equivalent-fuel-economy-calculation-final-rule](https://www.energy.gov/eere/vehicles/articles/10-cfr-part-474-petroleum-equivalent-fuel-economy-calculation-final-rule)   (I posted this same link in another post 2 days ago)

These changes incorporate the generation efficiency of electric power plants and the distribution losses of the electric grid.

This is a problem though.  ICE vehicle CAFE scores do not include distribution losses associated with shipping the fuel; like spills, leaks, fuel used in distribution vehicles, energy used pumping the fuel, and evaporation at the pump.

This will result in a 71% reduction in the EV fuel economy ratings that the NTHSA uses to distribute CAFE credits/penalties valued at $140 per MPG(e).  This will result in drastic changes especially for smaller footprint EVs.  This will not affect the ratings listed on [Fueleconomy.gov](http://Fueleconomy.gov)

A Nissan Leaf is rated at 141 MPGe currently, but after these new rules are fully phased in after 2026 the Nissan Leaf would have a CAFE adjusted rating of about 40 MPGe.  Because of the small footprint of the Leaf it will have an MPG target of about 76 MPGe in 2027.

This means that the Nissan Leaf would be subject to a penalty of over $5000 nominal worth of CAFE credits if it was still on sale in 2027.

There will be no subcompact EVs in the US.  You'll buy a Prius or an ICE truck like the car companies said you would.

\*\*edited, I messed up the math a little by using the public MPGe number

1dxt62g,"UK to Belgium in a (""small range"") BMW iX","So I've had my BMW iX40 since Nov '23 and I love it. I got the smaller version firstly because of cost (obviously) and secondly, I don't travel much on a day to day and the WLTP range of 260mi is plenty for me. I tried to drive as I would my old diesel car if I did long distances, i.e. stop when I needed food, the restroom or a comfort break, every time I stopped, I would try and charge even if it was a pitstop, just to prevent any stops just to charge the car.

I traveled 350mi from  Yorkshire (Northern England) to West Flanders in Belgium. Fully charged when I set off and stopped 120mi later for lunch and hit an IONITY rapid charger for 28 mins while I had some food. Charged from 53% - 90%.

Second stop was for a coffee break and to stretch the legs 78mi later at a Tesla supercharger for 11 mins. 62% - 80%.

Then the final UK charge was at the Tesla Superchargers in Folkestone while I waited for the train and though why not.

Stopped once in France to use the toilet and charged for 20 mins. I spent a little longer here as it cost me £0.25/kWh and wanted to maximise on the cheap Ultra rapid speeds.

The car averaged 3.5mi/kWh which was impressive af IMO. I did around 73mph on the motorway in the UK and stuck to the limits in France and Belgium.

I drove the car in Belgium to and back from the hotel to work (22mi daily round trip) and then after 4 days drove back home. I had free charging at work so made sure it was at 100% when I left work the day before coming home and set off from the hotel on 95% the day after.

Drove back in one go from Belgium to Calais (Eurotunnel). In the UK, stopped at the IONITY in Maidstone and got some food from McDonalds. Charged to 98% here, stopped for 30 mins in total. From here I drove the whole way back and got back home on 5%. The car telling me to stop and charge but I just wanted to get back and though I'm not paying for public charging when I can pay 7p/kWh at home!

The self drive functionality is amazing, takes the stress out of driving, keeps you in lane and you can even enjoy a cheeky McFlurry when driving without having to take each spoon like it could be your last ever.

Overall the car averaged **3.2mi/kWh** which is impressive for me considering most of it was on the motorway and its not the long range iX. Very impressed and if you're thinking of getting the ix40 because you're not travelling long distances **often** then I would defo. say get this over the iX50 and save yourself some cash!

TL;DR - If you're thinking of getting an EV then don't hesitate, you'll save a shed load in fuel if you have a home charger and if you have to make a stop to charge on long runs, just go to an ultra rapid charger and by the time you make hit the restrooms and get a coffee, its put like 50% in the car. Only thing you have to do is plan the journey, you can't as spontaneous as you would in an ICE car.",2024-07-07 22:41:37
1dxpsqa,What’s up with freeway steering wheel vibrations? ,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share an experience I recently had while shopping for a new EV and see if anyone else has encountered something similar. 

A few days ago, I went to my local Tesla center to test drive the Model 3 Highland. I've wanted to get myself a new EV, but during the test drive, I noticed something surprising. After reaching 80 km per hour on the highway, I felt some vibrations on the steering wheel. This continued all the way up to 120 km per hour. It wasn’t overly intense, but definitely unpleasant.

So, two days later, I decided to test a the only alternative that I like, so I went to the BMW center. I tested the i4 e40 and, you wont believe it, experienced almost the same feeling, though in a different speed range. The vibrations started after reaching 110 km per hour. 

As I was a bit frustrated, I did some research though German forums for the Tesla Highland, and various BMW models from iX to iX1 to i4. It turns out a proportion of users are experiencing these vibrations at motorway speeds as well. I also found out the same for BYD Seal users.

Also from what I've gathered, many Highland users have tried changing their tires and rebalancing them, but this hasn't solved the problem in most cases. This makes me think that these vibrations might not be entirely related to the tires. 

My point is: could it be possible that the drive units in EVs resonate at certain frequencies, causing these vibrations on motorways? Maybe this aspect of EV research isn’t 100% complete or fully understood yet. 

I know this might attract some negative responses, but I wanted to share my thoughts and hear your opinions. This is in no way intended as ICE vs EV debate.",2024-07-07 20:17:37
1dxoznx,Hybrid project - Series/ with a generator,"I have read most topics about this, and all referring to inefficiency of BMW i3, Chevy volt, and many more..... But in recent days, generators have gotten better with reduced size.

So listen to me,

1. **Motors** - Most ev motors are rated 160 - 200 wh/km, a 17.5 - 20kwh battery should cover 100km(62 miles) thus ample for 1 hr. Average consumption 18.75kwh at 100km/h.
2. **Generator** - Westinghouse 28kw [https://www.amazon.com/Westinghouse-Outdoor-Power-Equipment-WGen20000/dp/B09CHHJD3H?th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Westinghouse-Outdoor-Power-Equipment-WGen20000/dp/B09CHHJD3H?th=1)

This is prefered because of its smaller size that can fit into a bonnet like a Defender 110, has a 999cc engine consuming 65L (17.2gallons) in 11 hours. But since it has 20kw running watts, shall take average of 24kw as load giving 4.07kW per litre.

That's 24\*11 = 264Kwh.

Divide by 264/18.75 = 14.08 hours

Total distance covered = 100\*14.8 = 1,408 km

So total power produced 264kwh by generator can be consumed in 14.08 hours and total distance is 1,408km.

[In reference to these....](https://preview.redd.it/xr276n71f5bd1.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac3770b7470a444171e0b407764c260c33eeca3e)

**Adantages:**

1. Generator can be configured to autostart when battery % gets low. Mainly powering the ev motor and surplus recharging the battery.
2. Greatly reducing the battery size to like 20 - 25kwh considering 90% usable.
3. Reduced weight compared to complete ev.
4. No range anxiety.
5. Better fuel milage. 
6. No long charging hours for us without fast charging.

1. Energy losses in conversion from AC to DC then back to AC.
2. Very loud generator. Advice required.
3. Very expensive generator thus initial investment is high.",2024-07-07 19:43:48

1dxkt4w,One Year In -- Doing The Math,"I'm coming up on one year with my EV, a 2023 Hyundai Ioniq 6 Limited AWD (20"" wheels) and thought I'd give an update, mostly focused on costs.

I have a  48A (11.2 kW) Leviton Level 2 home charger and charge almost exclusively at home.  My electricity cost is $0.135 per kWh including taxes and surcharges. I don't live inside city limits, which would add another $0.045 per kWh in my area. I do not have variable pricing, that's the one residential rate and it can be adjusted annually with the approval of the State Public Utility Commission. The reality is the price has historically changed every 3 years or so, so it is very stable.

Gasoline in my area has averaged about $3.45 per US gallon over the last year. Gas prices are very volatile and can change multiple times a day but usually fluctuate weekly or so by a few pennies. But a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, or upcoming ""driving"" holiday, random Middle East whatever, and gas can bounce around.

I am very casual about running about, meaning I don't plan or combine trips and can easily make 2-3 runs to the same shop in a day if I forgot something. If I developed some discipline I could cut my milage by close to half, but as it is I approaching 22,000 miles in my first year. I live in a quiet neighborhood about 6-7 miles from all the major shops, from groceries to home improvement. I drive normally, meaning heat (cabin, steering wheel, seats) in the winter and cooling (cabin, vented seats) in the summer, and open windows when it is nice enough.

So, let's do some basic math. First the electric. Over the last year, winter and summer, I've averaged about 3.75 miles per kWh in fuel efficiency. It dips to about 3.3 in the dead of winter, where temperatures dipped into the 20s F for a couple weeks. It usually hovered just below freezing for lows in January and February. In summer my efficiency will rise to 4.3 or higher, with the temperatures hanging around in the low- to mid-90s F and evening lows in the upper 60s to low 70s. I have my car scheduled to charge at night, starting at 1:00 a.m. just because and with how I drive I can usually top my car off (80%) in 2 hours of charging.

Taking 22,000 miles and dividing it by 3.75 miles per kWh gives 5867 kWh of total electricity used by my driving. Multiplying that by $0.135 / kWh gives me $792 in ""total"" electric fuel costs for the past year. I put ""total"" in quotes because when I bought the car it came with 2 years free charging from Electrify America and I've used that option maybe a dozen times. (50 kWh average fast charge \* 12 sessions \* $0.135 cost to offset means I saved an extra $81 over the $792. I'm not counting that because it is a limited time offer and I have to drive 20 miles or so for the nearest EA charger and I only do that if I have some other reason to be near one.) So, $792 as a working number.

I traded in a 2014 Chevy Silverado 1500 that was getting around 17 MPG on average. Yes, apples to oranges in vehicles, but that is what I had. So, 22,000 miles divided by 17 miles per gallon gives 1,294 gallons of gasoline that would have been used by my old vehicle. At $3.45 per gallon average price, $4,465 in total fuel cost, meaning a straight fuel cost comparison has be saving $3,672 for the year with the EV and charging at home.

Adding in the extra $200 I get charged for EV registration in my State to offset the gasoline taxes collected for road maintenance, and $300 a year in higher insurance premiums brings the savings to $3,172 on the EV. But, gotta add the 4 x $80 oil changes the truck would have needed but the EV doesn't, one every 5,000 miles, and that brings me back to $3,492 annual savings. The truck was starting to get to the point of constant maintenance, so my savings were even greater, but that's more ""new car vs old car"" and not really an EV vs ICE thing. Well, there are a lot less parts that need service on my EV, but again ""new vs 13 year old, 250,000 mile"".

I did all this math on the whiteboard in my home office and showed my son who was driving a 2021 Mazda CX-50. His fuel costs were averaging $450 per month, with a 60 mile commute twice a week, plus young family running around. Two days later he traded the Mazda in for a 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E. Same monthly payment, but extended out for one extra year. $200 per year in added insurance costs, and $200 in EV registration. But his fuel costs dropped to $50 per month by charging at home. So, month one paid for the insurance and registration. Months 2 thru 12 offset 66% of his car payment, so definite win for the EV.

Obviously the numbers depend on how much you drive, but the more it is the better it comes out for the EV.

The extra bonus, both for me and my neighbor, are that we've had four multi-hour power outages in the last year. The Ioniq has V2L, meaning I plug an adapter into my charge port and an extension cord / power strip into that and I have 1.9 kVA of 120V power to keep our refrigerators, freezers, and Internet routers running for days. (The UK and EU version of the car do 3.6 kVA or 230V, depending on your local mains levels.)

1dxkp89,The case for (or against) software updates,"As a former Tesla and current Rivian owner - I love consistent and typically easy-to-apply software updates.  But it seems to often be considered a bad thing.

Naysayers, typically the ""never owned an EV"" crowd, or those who consciously chose a legacy automaker's EV (which often receives limited, or dealership installed updates), will have you believe that ""clearly Tesla and Rivian must be in Beta if they need software updates!  My car should be complete from the factory!""

As we propel ourselves to a singular 15"" touchscreen interface in most vehicles, there is no debating that you've got an iPhone on wheels.  Would you like to trade your current phone for an iPhone/Android from 2008?  Was Steve Jobs original vision perfect?  Heck, if that's the logic, then we should have never iterated the T-Mobile Sidekick or my Windows CE phone (it could play Doom, after all).

Maybe your EV has Carplay so the interface doesn't matter (as much).  That's cool too, we can talk about other quality of life features.  Battery preconditioning for fast charging on the Nav, keyless locking behavior, suspension quality, camp & pet modes, audio system personalization, the list goes on.  None of these things can truly be perfected, especially as consumer interface expectations evolve.

I loved my Rivian on day 1, 2022 and I love it even more 10 updates later.

I'm happy to have my mind changed - I have yet to own Hyundai, Chevy, Ford's, BMWs, etc, etc offerings. Perhaps they make the perfect car from the factory, or continually offer major software updates.",2024-07-07 16:37:50

1dxfdrg,Electric Vehicle Granny Leads,"I have a 58kWh/150kW VW ID3 Performance Pro, which is into the 4th year of its lease. VW has always stated that the original 58kWh ID3 has a best range of 261 miles. OK, that's the background.

I recently returned back to Southampton from a roadtrip to Cornwall. Normally, I would go with a full battery and top up sometime in Cornwall with a fast or rapid charge, run around, and then top up again before returning. I don't own a granny lead and had never charged with one. But this time I borrowed my nephew's Tesla granny lead and tried it out for a few overnights. And it was brilliant. My previous opinion would have been, ""yeah, they're ok in an emergency, but get to a destination charger"", which can make things more complicated. My opinion has changed. If you are doing a roadtrip to a destination, where you will base yourself, you can rely on a granny lead. Let me tell you why.

I started off with 260 odd miles range. Arrived in Cornwall with 80 miles because I pushed the acceleration/speed at times, plus it was windy and raining once I got past Dorset. It was 155 miles travelled. It had been in Comfort mode. Took about 3hrs 30 mins, with the odd Jam. Yeah, that was 180 miles power used.

So I plugged in the granny lead at my destination sometime later in the evening. In the late morning when I unplugged, I had 196 miles. Let's face it, that's excellent range for a run around a UK county over one day. The next time I plugged in with the granny lead, a couple of evenings later, I'd had 125 miles and finished with 209 miles, after charging overnight, for the return journey. And this is where it gets a bit surprising. I had to stop off at a Cornish Pasty shop, which was 6 miles out of my way, before heading for home. I got to the pasty shop with 211 miles \[yep, not a typo\]. When returning to the car, I popped it into Eco from Sport, which usually doesn't make the biggest difference anyway, and set off for the remaining 152 miles to travel. I went the Okehampton-Exeter route, but chose the wiggly, up/down south-coast route once past Exeter to Honiton. So, 211 miles - 152 miles travelled - and I end up with 98 miles, arriving at home in Southampton. It took 3hrs 15 mins, so sub-50 mph average, but I had been stuck in a 5 minute traffic jam at one point. It hadn't been especially warm, about 20°C throughout the journey. It wasn't windy, but fairly sunny.

So, 211-152=59.

98-59 = 39.

Where did those extra 39 miles come from. I'm astonished. Did all the weather variables, plus the change of Comfort mode on the outward journey, and Eco on the return, really make all that difference? And what of granny leads? I think I need to get one of my own from now on. Charging on roadtrips has, upto now, been the only slight stress point of owning my BEV. That has now gone.",2024-07-07 12:28:16

1dx45pf,I have been a EV family for 8 months and gone great.,I’m a proud owner of a MY22 (Jan 22) and my wife of a 19 ipace (Nov23). We swaped bc I like driving fast and take windy road so the MY is better for that and see like the comfort of the jag so we swapped cars. The autowipers on both cars suck. The Tesla is usually a little to fast for me still but the jag is too slow when behind another car but it is fine it’s by itself in the rain. Everyone says Tesla break down but none of them have broken down. The jag has been to the shop 3 times in 8 months of ownership its software and screens will just lag or freeze. Like me and my wife have profiles to change our gauge cluster screen to our liking but sometimes the car will delete them. It’s annoying but not a dealbreaker but i recommend it’s your only car but the ones with the update on the inside because I believe they upgraded the processor. The dealership will give you a new loaner which is nice because before the MY and ipace we had a crv and rdx. As for the Tesla no really issues expect changing the cabin air filter is ridiculously hard. This past weekend we put the cars to the test where we had my wife’s parents over and want to travel to a major city 2-3 hours away. My wife doesn’t trust public chargers another then superchargers. We have a 70% success rate with them and supercharger it’s a 98% success rate. My wife was temped to take the focus RS but I said we should try. It went well except for EA charge don’t have enough supply for demand meanwhile superchargers have plenty of supply to meet most of there demand. We are happy to be a full EV family they may not be ideal for everyone but for us they work well. If you have any questions go ahead and ask them.,2024-07-07 00:44:49

But besides my negative experience with that, it is comfortable to drive, have a decent real life range of 350 ish km, it’s okay soundproofed and have more than enough acceleration in 0-50 km/h. Unfortunately it is only available in front wheel drive at the moment, but a 4x4 is apparently coming late this year. If that’s in Norway or globally I have no idea.

1dx0ynf,e-tron residual value forecast,"I posted this in r/Audi too but am curious what you all have to say. 

I have a 2019 e-tron prestige with roughly 42k miles. No issues or damage. In Feb. 2020, it originally sold for $83,705. In 2021, it sold for $63,498. In May 2023, it was roughly $50,000 (when I purchased it). Car Edge ([https://caredge.com/audi/e-tron/depreciation](https://caredge.com/audi/e-tron/depreciation)) lists the residual value of a 6 year e-tron at 54.27%, which would equate to roughly $45,000. But a private party sell estimate today is only roughly $25,000. That shouldn't be the case until it is roughly 9 years old.

I am trying to forecast when I will owe less than this car is worth, but I can't project with the estimate being so far off. Does anyone have a better depreciation forecast or idea? Is it going to be worth $15,000 this time next year? $22,000?",2024-07-06 22:07:24

1dvionj,Why are stores’ EV chargers at the front?,I went to IKEA today and saw they had three EV charging spots. Two of which were occupied by ICE BMWs. I know it’s hard for people to leave these open especially when the parking lot is full and these are right at the front - next to the handicapped spots. It seems like one of the common issues with publicly available EV chargers (especially those at stores) is that they are always taken by ICE drivers who don’t care one bit. It seems like this issue could easily be avoided if the spots were placed at the back of the lots. It would really discourage any wrongful use. ,2024-07-04 22:09:02

As I see this is a big problem/concern for current EV owners and even new current EV owners. Where you are fully hesitant on which vehicle to buy due to an ever-changing charging port standard that will likely continue to change for the near future. 

I just thought of something that maybe possible, or may not be.

Why don't we build ""New Charging Stations"" with modular connectors (aka like modern wall outlets) where different EV owners can buy their charging cables directly from their select manufacture and then when they come to a fast charge station they just plug in their level three capable charger cord connector (which maybe CHADEMO, CCS, NACS) then since they use different handshake protocols have the machine interface have you select which charging port you'll use and then it'll change the protocol handshake through via software? 

Again, im not an engineer this may not be possible. THOUGH if it is… this will ensure that older EVs with old charging standards wont be obsolete and thrown away in a junk yard because they dont have the newest charging standard? 

if anyone has any inside knowledge or intellect regarding this theory. Please fill us in if this is a possibility?",2024-07-04 00:46:22

1dujry9,Think it's unethical to support a Chinese EV brand? ,"Good sirs and ladies: Any racist or hatefull replies or the like will be removed and may ruin what I hope can be a serious discussion, so please ne civil. 

The Chinese EV brands seem to bring a lot of value for the price. However, as an European I have some serious issues if one should support these brands. They say that you can vote with your wallet, and my concerns with Chinese car brands are:

1. Worker conditions being seriously worse than in Europe? 
2. Chinese government maybe forcing companies to give away user data? 
3. If you consider buying one, you may be contributing to an economy who historically does not place a high value on human rights (think the ongoing Uyğur situation or their neglectance to condemn the war in Ukraine). 

I may be wrong on some of this, and highly welcome counter arguments. I also hope to hear from people outside of Europe, to challange the Eurocentric bias I do have. 

On counter arguments, the Chinese brands seem highly competetive, and supporting such brands is good to drive innovation in the car industry. I also support global trade and the shutting people out-strategy has had some serious downsides historically. 

If you get offended by this post, know that my intentions are not to provoke in any way; I just want to welcome a serious discussion (that may belong on an ethic forum, but I wanted to hear the reactions from this community).

I have read on other forums that the car is getting used to our driving habits? Loosing 25% range right out the gate is kinda worrisome. We use the car as a commuter for work. So it’s driven about 140 miles a day and it’s 95% freeway driving. Its efficiency is at 3.5 kWh.

1dug1hh,Problems with Ford MachE ,"I’ve had an ongoing issue with purchasing a new MachE and my BlueCruise not working. I can go into greater details for those thinking about a MachE but I think this may help current owners. 

It took 3 months to get into a dealer and get it fixed due to the dealers being overwhelmed with other MachE repairs/recalls. 

Ford refuses to refund me for the time I didn’t have BlueCruise even though I paid for a $2000 3 year BlueCruise subscription at the time I purchased my MachE. 

I called so many people at Ford I should have been on Ford’s payroll. No one helped or really could care about my issue. I finally wrote to Ford’s Executive department with a CC to Jim Farley. 

I did get a contact at Ford’s Executive Office. She didn’t really help but she did say she was a point of contact for future issues. I don’t think it’s realistic a customer would have to do as much as I did only to be told Ford couldn’t  care less about me or what vehicle I purchased in the future. 

I have this departments phone number and anyone can DM me if they want the contact info. Don’t bother calling Ford Customer Relations unless you just want to get upset or want simplified answers like “have you read the instructions?” or “try turning it off and turn it back on.”  Just skip the red tape and go directly to my contact. 

Ford’s quality now is really at a low point. Their customer service is horrible and it feels like you are talking to someone at a cell phone company or Amazon when you try and get something addressed at FMCO. It’s sad because I know people at Ford are very talented and work hard. It’s a poor reflection on those people that do care about the company and a customer experience with their products. 

EDIT:  if you don’t own a Ford MachE don’t buy one. Save yourself the hassle and problems with service and dealing with Ford. Ford has been scaling back their dedication to the MachE and Lightening due to their shareholder demands for profits on their EV investments. Couple that with Ford’s terrible quilts and it’s a recipe for disaster to be a Ford EV owner. If you do decide to get a MachE understand it’s fine until things go wrong even a simple matter like mine. Lease one instead of buying it",2024-07-03 14:41:56

https://www.plugshare.com/location/591903

This location has been in the works for like the last year and a half as part of the evgo/pilot deal. It was originally marked to be installed one exit north at an actual pilot station.  But there's a battery plant being built at that exit as well som I'm guessing that construction is why they decided to install this at its current spot as listed on plugshare.

The cabinets have been physically installed since the beginning of the year. But they still have not turned them on or added them to the evgo app. Evgo customer support didn't have any info on when it might go live (which I would have actually been surprised if they did have that info but figured I'd ask anyway)

Once cabinets get installed, does it normally take them over 6 months to turn them on. I drive that corridor fairly often and I've been dreaming of the day I can access the superchargers in Elizabethtown, or have this evgo come online. Would be a game changer for my commute.

Not for the environment, but because they are simply better cars.

The best way to push advancements and society forward is to leave behind and alienate laggards.
So I propose, as a community, instead of ""ICE vehicles/cars"" we adopt something along the lines of ""legacy cars"" or ""old style"" cars. Literally anything that minimalizes legacy cars to the point where anti EV folks are ashamed to admit they drive an old style car.

1dttvs9,New Community Tradition Proposal: Eeveing ,"Hello all!

So a few days ago I was driving in town and saw a jeep with a dashboard full of rubber duckies. Intrigued I googled it and discovered Duck Duck Jeep! I loved the idea as a way of using small acts of kindness to help strengthen a car community.

What if the EV community had something similar?

Proposing ""Eeveing"":  a traditon where when you spot an EV you like, you can leave them a small Eevee themed item to show your appreciation and spread some good will. 

Full details and FAQ (including pictures) can be found here https://tinyurl[dot]com/eeveed

but to summarize: 

The default medium suggested is small Eevee themed vinyl decal (files for which are freely available to all on the FAQ!). Cheap, easy to make, and minimally wasteful if unwanted by the recipient.

to be completely clear: the idea would be to leave the decal **WITH BACKING PAPER STILL ON** somewhere like in the handle or under a wiper for the owner to find and decide what to do with. **NOBODY SHOULD EVER APPLY A DECAL DIRECTLY ONTO ANOTHER PERSON'S CAR!! THAT IS NOT IN THE SPIRIT OF EEVEING**

People can still enjoy the decals without putting them on their car, maybe in a sticker book or on their dash or just giving to a child or pokemon lover they know.

Ideally, the Eevee should have a note explaining the tradition.

So please if you like the idea, make/get some Eevees and spread some good will! There are free designs and ideas for how to make your own decals on the FAQ. 

and if you find yourself on the receiving end of an Eevee, I hope it and the knowledge that someone thinks your car is awesome brightens your day! Even if you end up giving the Eevee away.

1dtqz5l,For 2024 Models: Any EVs that can max out a 350kW (North American) Charger?,"I read that the Lucid Air could (?), but I was curious if any other models have managed to max it out? 

And of course what really matters is the charge curve, I actually feel like ""what's the most % battery it could ever possibly recharge in 15 mins, ideal conditions"" would be a more fun, eye-opening benchmark to compare different models. I was actually surprised to see the Hyundai/KIA 800v models [outperforming most of the luxury brands](https://conormclaughlin.net/2023/02/visualizing-electric-vehicle-ev-charging-curves/), keep it above 200kW past half charge. Only the e-tron GT comes close. Also disappointing to see how slow the F150 Lightning max charging rate was, given the huge battery. It's almost like the charge curve is where you really get see who's got the better EV tech under the hood (the new kids on the block, Lucid, Rivian, Tesla + Hyundai/Kia) vs. the legacy automakers.",2024-07-02 17:05:36

1dtpyvi,Why does it feel like EV batteries haven't improved at all in the West?,"Upon reading the review of the new Audi SQ6 e-tron, and finding out it weights 5500 lbs and has a range of 250 miles, I began to ask myself why even the best EVs of today don't seem to have better batteries than the Chevy Bolt of 2017. 

After all the SQ6 is built on the latest PPE pure-EV architecture, and I'm assuming Audi is using the upper tier of batteries available. But in terms of energy density and cost, it feels like EVs haven't improved much since 2017. 

After all the Model 3 released in 2017, and the 2017 model would still be a competitive car today as long as it's priced a bit lower than what it was at launch. I think that's an indictment of how things haven't improved much. 

So a few questions :

1) Why are Western automakers STILL not using LFP in every car with less than 100 kwh? If they're going to be heavy pigs anyway, adding a couple hundred more pounds is no biggie, compared to saving thousands in cost, and batteries that can be charged to 100% and last a million miles.

2) Why is the price parity between EVs and an equivalent ICE much higher than the actual cost of the battery? Like the Equinox EV being $15000 more than an ICE Equinox. The Ioniq 6 being $15000 more than the Sonata. Aren't EVs were cheaper to build, with the battery system being the only thing more expensive? 

3) Also, have you noticed a lot of automakers have stopped revealing technical details of their batteries? Especially the weight. The SQ6 e-tron is 1300 lbs heavier than the similarly sized, gas-powered SQ5 with the 3.0L V6 turbo. At the bare minimum, that means its battery is at least 1300 lbs for a 94kwh pack,  based on the assumption that a battery-less EV is the same weight or lighter than a full ICE car. That's an energy density of more than 6 kg/kwh, which is what Chevy already achieved years ago with the Bolt. That's just embarassing for an OEM's best EV effort in 2024.",2024-07-02 16:24:30

1dtpawh,Range Anxiety MIGHT have saved us last night.  ,"Went to an amusement park that was about 130mi away yesterday.   Our EV9 has 280mi range so we should have been able to make the round trip without charging. 

On the way to the park, I forgot to put it in Eco mode.   We still had 52% charge when we arrived so the plan was to put it in Eco for the ride home and we should be fine.   Had a buffer of about 30mi.  

I think we must have hit a head wind or something because even in Eco mode, we were getting unusually-low efficiency and that buffer started to thin out a little.  Since I had the whole family in the car and a dog that had been cooped up all day at home (don't worry, our neighbors were checking in on him to give him potty/play breaks) I decided to give in to the anxiety and hit a charger that was just off the highway.

Stopped at an EA that had 4 open 350's and plugged in for a whole six minutes to get about 20% more charge - more than enough to make sure we can get home without any worries.  

As we were getting back on the highway, there were fire trucks everywhere - one coming up from behind us, another off in the distance headed our way.  Once we were on the highway, saw another crossing an overpass.   

A mile or two later I saw brake lights and fire truck lights.   They had JUST arrived at the scene of a really nasty multi-vehicle accident - an SUV had it's rear cargo area bashed in and was missing a wheel, another was spun around the wrong way and a sedan was upside-down on it's hood/windshield. 

There's no way for me to be sure, but it struck me that had we not stopped to charge for those few minutes, we could very well have been involved in that accident.

As an added bonus, even though we've used up our free 1000kWh from EA that came with the car purchase, our charge session was completely free.  No idea why, but I'll take it!",2024-07-02 15:57:07

1dt4a24,Speed vs Efficiency ,"Now I know this is obvious, but I guess I just realized how much your efficiency is dependent on your speed.  My i4 overall efficiency is only 3.1 mi/kWh lately.  Pretty bad.  I assumed it was because I took off the original tires for the PS4 A/S (which I love otherwise).  

Well last weekend I took a long trip.  The first 200 miles we were driving 60 between small bits of 35 on back roads, and theb last 300 was 85 on the highway.  I did 3.7 mi/kWh for the first part, 3.1 for the second.  I was shocked at how much different it was. Same driver, same weather, same terrain (all flat Florida), same everything except speed gave a 16% efficiency loss. Then I realize that I do most of my miles either on very short trips or at 85 on the highway to work. No wonder my efficiency is so bad. 

Now I know this isn't a big revelation and I guess I already knew this, but to see such a huge efficiency difference for 15 mph was surprising. I thought that maybe other people wondering why they aren't getting the effect l efficiency they expected so maybe this will help someone.

Also, two notes.  First, it isn't an issue in practice.  Electricity is cheap and I have plenty of range.  Second, in case anyone is going to try to use this as an anti-EV thing remember that gas cars are even more effected by speed than EVs.

1dsqm9f,The U.S and their little monopoly ,"Canadian here, and I've been paying attention to the automarket for the past decade or so and just these past few months have been the stupidest in North America. 

No hate to any Americans, just the system in general in North America.

This system seems to go like this from the U.S. Gov't:

Step 1: global economists suggest the American economy isn't the superpower it used to be. The dollar isn't tied to anything that it should be. This spells trouble for America's ""free market capitalism"" system.

Step 2: Other countries like China creates incredibly advanced EVs that are far better, easier to recharge and replace batteries, and most importantly, **about $10k** - *in the face of American automakers that have slowly convinced the public that cars should cost $50-75k. Obviously this pisses off the American automakers.*

Step 3: President goes on record calling the Chinese contribution to technological advancements ""cheating"" and ""not real capitalism"" simply because they did it better. Also claims that it's cheating because China assisted these countries with state funding, as if A) that's some sort of bad thing, and B) that the U.S. doesn't do this in the form of bailouts, stock buybacks, and other forms of funding.

Step 4: Sanctions Chinese manufacturers after giving a 100% tariff on electric Chinese cars. Which ironically still makes them tens of thousands of dollars cheaper than u.s. domestic manufacturers would like to convince us is an acceptable price. 

Step 5: The supreme Court removes the powers of their corporate regulating bodies. This can theoretically allow manufacturers of all kinds to be ""more competitive"", while destroying the environment, destroying labour relations, and letting American manufacturers to be as seedy as they need to be to make America 'number one'.

Like, I know the U.S. has always convinced American car buyers that less efficient, larger, more expensive, and generally worse cars are acceptable, while the rest of the world has safe, economical and cheaper cars. 

But this is just sad, desperate and weird. 

Again, as a Canadian I say this mainly because we are subject to whatever decision that the U.S. makes in its auto markets. I want cheap electric cars but Canada won't go to bat against American policy makers. And I think Americans should be pissed off about this.",2024-07-01 11:26:05

1dsojmw,First impressions after a long trip on an MG4 Standard range,"I just did my first long trip (500km roundtrip) on an MG4 51kWh and wanted to give my 2 cents, this will be a review of the car itself as well as some generals regarding BEV I guess.


**RANGE**

First of all: the range anxiety disappeared after the first 100km, when I confirmed the mileage displayed was pretty truthful, a lot of folks like to say that WLTP ranges are not realistic and very generous, I didn't find it to be true, I reached my destination with 70-80km to spare which would bring it to 330km total.

I had mixed roads between urban, extra urban and highway, managing to always keep the max allowed speed without any issues, the highway had a bit of spotty traffic which probably helped me conserve my range, I'd have ended up my trip with less mileage otherwise but I was still within the total advertised range of the car by far. 

**COMFORT**

Comfort while traveling on well maintained roads and highways is just top notch, quiet, comfy andl the lka/adaptive CC is actually surprisingly good, I've heard lot of shit about the MG LKA being bad/too abrupt but I didn't find that to be true, idk if it's a matter of people not being used to LKA in general or if they made it smoother with updates but it works well in my opinion, I tried other cars with LKA and while MG's one is not the top of the crop it's pretty much middle of the pack.

The comfort suffers a lot on harsh roads tho, this is probably due to the overall higher weight of the machine(again, a common point of all EVs), the suspensions are not great in these situations, I won't say it's a back breaker but definitely not the most comfortable car under these conditions. 

*INFOTAINMENT*

Another weak point for the brand imo, it's kinda slow and not as snappy as I'd like, it's not a major issue since music controls and AC controls can all be set into the wheel physical buttons so I don't have to fidget too much with the touch screen, as for everything else it's all a single time setup and then you will just connect Android auto/carplay for the rest of your life so any doubious choices and translation issues have 0 impact on your daily driving experience. 

*CHARGING*

I think I made the best choice of my life going for the Standard model instead of the higher-end ones, it comes with LFP batteries (other models come with NMC batteries) which means I don't have to worry about going over 80% charge.

While the overall range is inferior to that of NMC batteries the fact that I can charge it up to 100% basically gives me a similar range to higher kW/h cars in most cases, at home charging is just super simple and quick.

Charging at charging stations is a bit of a hassle due to fragmentation of services, some are quick and easy, some require you to jump through some hoops, it's always better to plan ahead and register to all the required apps on your phone beforehand, when I reached my destination I had to spend 10 minutes registering to the operator's charging app before I could start charging, with that said I had no issues afterwards, a strong point of the MG4 is that the charging plug gets locked in the socket while charging so nobody can remove it until you choose to, which I thought was the same for every EV but learned in this sub that's not actually the case for everyone.

*HANDLING*

Wow, just wow, it's amazing, I've driven BMW and Mercedes with worse handling than this car.

*HILLY CONDITIONS*

On my trip I had to traverse some mountain roads so I wanted to dedicate a special part of my review to this because EVs fucking rock the shit out of any and every ICE in those conditions. 
Even on the steepest slopes the car would just eat the road without any issue, I could accelerate as much as I wanted and it would just keep up, no ICE I've ever driven had a remotely similar response in these situations, and it was as quiet as always, werehas on my old car whenever I had to do the same trip it'd scream bloody murder and kill my ears for the whole duration of the road. 

And then came the downhill parts and if I was impressed with the uphill performance the downhill one is even smoother.

No more constant braking and slowing down to avoid rolling down the mountain side,, no more high rpm motor yelling in my face, not only the experience is smooth as hell, but I just kept smiling watching the car regenerating the battery and gaining overall 10km of range while travelling downhill for 15-20, functionally giving me 25-30 extra km, just wow.

*OVERALL EXPERIENCE*
TL;DR: the car itself has some minor drawbacks tbh but it comes at, in my opinion, an unbeatable price point for what it offers (on the same price bracket all I could find were city cars with very limited range) and now that I used it for an actual long trip I have to say that all my fears have been dispelled, there's no way I'll ever go back to ICEs, the world needs more BEVs",2024-07-01 09:11:40

1dshpts,Victoria (Australia) road trip report (rental Model Y RWD),"I have a Model Y LR myself, but decided to rent a Model Y RWD (CATL LFP battery with around 55kWh usable capacity) from SIXT to see how the rental experience was like, and whether the smaller battery would give any range anxiety. I drove down a part of the Great Ocean Road until Apollo Bay, then took mountain/forest roads to Ballarat via Colac, and then returned to Melbourne using the M8 motorway.

Tldr - range anxiety didn't present itself, the RWD is more than enough range.

I picked up the vehicle from SIXT Blackburn. The car itself mildly reeked of cigarettes; at least it was already charged to 93%, but I wasted some time driving back home to pick up my stuff, and then drive back once I realized that the Chargefox (our equivalent of Electrify America/Ionity) RFID card for complimentary charging that was supposed to be in the car wasn't there. I ended up wasting a bit more time for the staff to find one, which they took out of a Model 3 that wasn't being used that day. The tire pressure were also all off and unbalanced, so I had to make a quick stop at a gas station in Doncaster East to rectify them. I ended up leaving the gas station with 90% SOC and started my trip from there.

The first stop was at the Chargefox chargers at RACV Torquay at the start of the Great Ocean Road, after having driven 133km. I arrived with 60% and left it at a 50kW Tritium charger, and went into the resort for a (mediocre) lunch of fish and chips. By the time I finished my lunch, the car was already fully charged to 100%.

From there, I then drove to Lorne (making some stops at the side of the road for photos) and eventually ended up in Apollo Bay for another round of fish and chips (excellent). This was 118km from Torquay, with quite a bit of elevation changes in between. SOC on arrival was 78%.

I left Apollo Bay with 76% and drove to Sebastopol (south of Ballarat), 162km away and gaining \~ 400 metres in elevation. SOC on arrival was 22%. We then left the car at a Chargefox AC charger, using the Type 2 cable provided by SIXT in the frunk, charging at 7kW while we had dinner at a pokies/pub across the street and picked up some groceries, returning to the car with 40% SOC.

From there, I drove about 7-8km around town and visited a bank of vandalized chargers at Ballarat Central. Surprisingly, one 50kW Tritium charger was still in service and providing free charging, while the other 350kW Tritium units were still in a vandalized state more than 6 months since they were attacked. I didn't charge there and opted to leave with 37% SOC.

102km later (downhill but with some headwinds), I arrived at a Toyota dealership in Altona with a Schneider 120kW charger, arriving at 10%. I plugged in and charged for less than 15 minutes, leaving with 44% SOC. From there, it was another 36km back home, arriving with 34% SOC.

The weather was rainy and quite windy the entire day but despite that, range anxiety was never an issue. For the entire day, I averaged 15.4 kWh/100km (or around 4.03 miles/kWh). 

SIXT did a (mostly) good job with the rental experience - a Tesla UMC with a 240V/10A tail was provided along with a Type 2 - Type 2 cable. They also allowed customers to return EVs with whatever battery level remaining. However, they should prep the car better by always leaving the (advertised) complimentary charging card in the car itself. Furthermore, they never bothered giving the car with the latest updates that would have enabled matrix headlights and better auto-wiper behavior.

That being said, AUD 72/day and zero charging costs was definitely cheap by local standards. An ICE would have easily cost AUD 100+ in petrol alone for the same trip (I did \~550 km/ 342 mi), not even factoring in the cost of the rental itself (which is also around the same price as the Tesla).

Ignoring the charge times in the picture above, this is my newest all electric road Mustang Mach E trip personal best.

My wife and I drove to pick up my son and his friend from a summer camp in New Mexico. We left Thursday night from work and stayed the night in Abilene. We stayed at the Holiday Inn because they had a charger and planned to charge to 100%. But unfortunately, two people were already plugged in, which I would say is ""just the way the cookie crumbles"", but I was kind of upset that both vehicles were already at 100% charge when we arrived. And both vehicle owners just left their cars plugged in all night. \*Sigh\*.

So that means we had to wake up a bit earlier on Friday to and drive to Sweetwater to get to the next fast charger (No fast chargers in Abilene yet). After Sweetwater we go rural roads the rest of the way. Driving through Post Texas we lost 10 miles of range due to elevation change climbing the Cap Rock! We fast charge in Lubbock at a pretty nice Chevy dealership. And drive to Clovis NM where there is free fast charging!

So we stay the night in Las Vegas, which is under severe water restrictions right now. Thankfully NMDoT has a Fast Charger just outside of town. We made good use of that because our destination is about 1500ft climb into the mountains.

On the way back, we stay the night in Lubbock at a hotel with a charger. There are two stalls and both were open when we arrived so we plug in. The Ford App estimated 100% charge by 9:30pm. At 92% charge I get a notification that my car has stopped charging. I go out to see an Audi drive had unplugged my car and plugged it into his! Keep in mind, there was still another charger available. His windshield was very deeply tinted and I didn't even realize he was in it while I was cursing at his car. He steps out and is clearly not the kind of person I was expecting to step out of an electric Audi. A young guy with tatoos and earloops that was very apologetic and clearly was not very experienced with how this charging thing worked. He told me he was on his way to Denver. Yeah, the dude had a long way to go. So I explained to him that he would be better served if he found CCS fast chargers, like that GM dealership down the road. I wasn't as upset about him stealing my plug (Truth is he was probably just trying to steal my charge, but I felt bad for him. Looked like he needed some help.)

We pick up the kids and drive back to Abilene. WOW is there a difference in range going down hill! We got an easy 30%+ more range coming out of NM. We would barely get 140 miles of range at 80% charge in our MME going west and nearly 200 going east. Overall from Dallas to Camp is a 7500ft climb. The drive with stops for charging/lunch/bathroom/etc. was right about 12 hours each way total (obviously not including the hotel stays).

One of the more unexpected/yet easily expected observations was during rural road passing. I'm used to passing in gas cars (typically in 4-cylendars). When I pass in a gas car I'm always sweating a bit because I move into the on-coming traffic lane and slam on the accelerator and it takes the engine a beat to rev up, and when it does rev up it sounds like it's about to explode. But in electric, when I move into the on-coming traffic lane it's instant torque and no change in engine sound. Just the same road/wind noise. Made passing feel all too easy!

Anyhow, just wanted to give myself a little virtual pat on my own back for not chickening out and taking the gas Honda. The MME is such a more comfortable ride, especially with Blue Cruise, and we really needed the extra room for all the camp gear.",2024-07-01 01:05:31

1dscak8,Why I got a Hybrid instead of an EV,"I'm here posting because I noticed some people here like to criticize folks for not buying an EV. They have this attitude that if you don't have an EV you are not cool or you are an idiot. I am by no means against EV and I do think it is the future but I want to give you folks my rationale for not purchasing an EV and instead, I got myself a Corolla Hybrid.

When I was car shopping two years ago, there were two main criteria that I was looking at which were cost and reliability.

1. Cost- My budget was $27k max. If you look at the cost of EVs, most are $30k+. [https://insideevs.com/news/565883/electric-car-prices-us/](https://insideevs.com/news/565883/electric-car-prices-us/) Of course you might argue that if I get a bigger loan to get an EV, eventually, it will pay off from the fuel price and maintenance cost. Sure, you can make that argument, but I'm in the financial position where I could make that bet. It is kind of like when people say that I should get solar panels at my house because it will pay itself off within 10-20 years. Ok, where am I going to get the money to do that? Get another loan? Another argument you might want to add is that the Chevrolet Bolt is (or was since production has discontinued) very affordable. But it is a Chevrolet which leads to my second criteria that is reliability.
2. Reliability- My family has had many Toyotas in the last 30 years. We also had other brands as well but no other brands beat Toyota when it comes to reliability. In fact, any articles and survey that you read when it comes to the reliability of car brands, Toyota is always up there in the top. Can you say the same for Hyundai, Tesla, Nissan, and Chevrolet? Nope. I have asked dealerships and mechanics on giving me arguments against buying a Toyota in terms of reliability. They don't have any and that means a lot. Unfortunately, Toyota is a bit late in the EV game and the only EV is the BZ4X which is $43k.

I know that some of you might want to point to BYD since that is the headline nowadays. Very cheap from China and a ""good"" brand. Hell no. I'm Chinese most Chinese would not buy Chinese brand. If you go to China, most Chinese would not buy Chinese brand if they have the money. Why? That is because 99% of Chinese brand are complete junk. However, for that 1%, those companies make exceptional products. Companies like DJI for drones and OnePlus for phones do make excellent products. Does BYD belong to that 1%? I dont know yet but statistically speaking there is an extremely low chance that they will be.

  
Edit: At no point I'm attacking EV. I will probably get an EV once Toyota have more options. A lot of you have proven my point. You guys are triggered and immediately attacked me why I chose a Hybrid over an EV.",2024-06-30 21:38:06

2. If the car and/or accessories are left on accidentally, while the car is charging, would that drain the 12V battery, making the whole thing a brick, even if the EV battery is at 100%? Or should the 12V battery keep charging in that case (esp. if it's plugged in so SOC is well over 35% the whole time).
3. Other than forgetting to turn the car off when we park at home, are there other parasitic drains on the 12V we should be worried about?

1ds254x,Fastest residential lvl2 charging options across different continents?,"What are the fastest lvl2 charging options across different continents possible? (Not limited by a vehicle's onboard charger, but rather the supply available)

Europe
As I believe the maximum power output from a 3ph output is about 380V-415V (mainland - UK). 16/32Amps are standard outputs? So anywhere between 6kw and 13kw? what's the amperage and voltage of 22kw lvl 2 charging ?

North America
It is a smorgasbord. We have 120V single phase, 240V split phase, 208V 3ph and 480V 3ph. 480V is out of the question, since it's mostly industrial and large commercial supply. 240V is larger voltage than 208V3ph, so let's go with it. We have ranging from 30Amps to as high as 80Amps (new homes or upgradable). So, between 7kw - 19.2kw? I'd throw out 80Amps, because it is EV specific. That should leave us at 50Amps, so, between 7kw - 12kw?

China/Asia
The standards for what level of power is already supplied to residential is different? Most of the housing in China is apartment/flat based, rather large buildings unlike Europe and North America. So, what is the level of electrical power already supplied to, say a 25 story building with 6 apartments on each floor? Including fire floors, and other utility stuff in the building, along with first 5 floors for parking, about 120ish apartments? What kind of power input is for the building? I know it is supplied at 380V 3ph supply, what's the amperage? I'm guessing 1000Amps? I don't really know about standards in Chinese/Asian electrical systems, due to the literature being in Mandarin or Korean and the absolutely trash grid setup in Japan being in Japanese.



This question - discussion is a way to better understand whether already existing availability infrastructure in terms of power supply required for high speed (>8kw) lvl 2 charging affects the penetration of electric vehicles? Assuming about 12 hours available for home lvl2 charging, going from 20%-80% shouldn't require more than 8 hours.

1ds1uvd,First BYD Impressions from a BMW Snob in Mexico,"I finally went to the local BYD dealer here in Leon, Mexico. I like cars and occasionally enjoy going window shopping. 

For context, I’ve owned only BMWs and a couple of MINIs for the last 26 years. Currently drive an ‘08 M5, an ‘11 1M and an ‘18 X5.

I’ve been toying with the idea of going electric. My experience with Tesla is limited to driving a good friend’s Model S in the bay area quite extensively. On Model 3s and Ys I have only ridden as a passenger. There is no Tesla store in my city.

I’ve been dismissing Chinese cars as cheap cars with terrible safety since they arrived in Mexico in force about 3 years ago. My understanding is that BYD is the least cheap Chinese brand.

Well, I do now understand why BYD is selling more than Tesla. I sat on the cars at the dealer (Seal and Han). The dealer itself is very well set up, closer to a BMW dealer than a mainstream dealer. The sales guy was knowledgeable, much more than usual in my experience. I was offered a test drive of a Seal RWD and took it. This is a Model 3 RWD competitor and it’s actually about 6K more expensive than that Tesla.

The interior seems to be on an incredibly better level than any Model 3 I have ridden in. The standard equipment is incredibly complete, fit and finish is I think comparable to Mazda. The car rides well, it is fast enough (slower than the Tesla). Quiet and solid. The demo had about 3,000 miles. Felt new - as it should. Ride quality is good but the suspension doesn’t feel as well sorted and refined as a BMW. Acceleration was ok but I drove the base Seal with rear motor only. Enough for almost everyone I think.

I think these are the things I like over the Tesla:

- Interior fit and finish
- Standard equipment (360 camera for example among many, many  others)
- 6 year bumper to bumper warranty and 8 year battery warranty
- Local dealer and service shop with actual humans to talk to (this is huge to me)
- Dealer experience
- Designs

Tesla is….a bit faster, has more storage space and (big if with all the cost cutting) may be more reliable. I guess that’s about it.

Finally, I am definitely team USA rather than team China but Elon is about the last american I want to support so that levels the playing field in this case.

I am not buying anything immediately, but I have liked cars all my life and thought It would be interesting to share here. The BYD dealer really changed my whole perception of the brand in one visit and test drive.

For context, a BMW i4 is twice the price of a Seal here without marching options. A Ioniq 5 is 40% more.",2024-06-30 13:46:36

Even if one pedal driving is disabled, you’re still able to come to a complete stop using regen exclusively since the brake pedal prioritizes regen. So long as you’re not hitting the brakes too hard, you can rely entirely on regen as you would with one pedal driving.

Another thing is that regen isnt as efficient as simply coasting. The process of converting kinetic energy to electrical energy isnt 100% efficient, sources say you’re losing 10-20% to heat etc. I’m sure you can theoretically coast with one pedal driving, but it’s certainly harder to be accurate with the throttle pedal than simply doing 0 inputs.

But I am going to be renting each of these cars for a few weeks, so I can make a choice after living with them for a while. 

But I don't currently have a charger installed at home, and even if I did, sometimes I do long journeys where I would need to charge away from home. 

One of the locations I often visit, does have free chargers if you park in their parking lot - which is reasonable. Just 7kwh chargers, but 5 hours would cost me £7.50.

  
I ask as last time I rented an EV, it cost me double than what it would cost as diesel to use public chargers. Admittedly, I got rinsed at Shell and BP + motorway service stations, lol. 

  
I don't mind if it costs the same as diesel/petrol but paying more than that is a joke. I read everyone says Tesla superchargers are the most affordable usually? But do they support ccs2? last time I stopped at a motorway service with Tesla superchargers, it seemed as if the adapters wouldn't fit ccs2.

I drive a 2020 Leaf S or whatever the base model is. I found through experimentation that my Leaf doesn't like speeds over 65 mph epecially with winds and headwinds on the highway. Really eats up my range. So I usually take frontage roads and country roads and it only adds about 30 to 45ish min to my drive including a charge stop. Planning on charging it up to or around 95 to 98 percent the day before. With my first ever Chademo charge stop in North or Central Milwaukee.

My Leaf really likes city driving at 20 to 40 mph and gets pretty good range when I go 35 to 55mph. But again 65mph+ I get very nervous watching that percentage and range drop very quickly... or do you think I'd make it just fine since I'm going faster and covering more ground. I am in no rush and can take my time going to Chicago, I just don't want to take 6 or 7 hours to get there.

I have ABRP and all the apps for the different charging stations ready to go. I don't plan on using the highway too much,  just to get through certain parts of Milwaukee. 

But any other tips or tricks for a first time EV owner's first longer roadtrip. And are dealerships hit or miss with charging or should I go to a Nissan dealership. Or should I not bother with them...? I just see a lot of dealerships with Chademo chargers along my route.",2024-06-28 22:55:48

So, let's be real. An EV making engine sounds is dumb.  
  
But still, muscle car brands have been making efforts to allow their newer EV vehicles produce sound to appease car enthusiasts. But I don't think they're going about it the right way. Everything I've seen thus far is just an overly exaggerated big speaker. The 2025 Dodge Charger in particular basically has this. They're all trying to mimic something that makes EVs just feel like a poser. If it's making ICE engine sounds, it's basically pretending to be something it's not.

First things first, EVs DO make sound, they're just very quiet. My initial thought with the 2025 Charger's Fratzonic system was that it was amplifying the sound an EV motor makes to give it  a unique personality from other ""speakers"", but found out that was incorrect when they changed it to sound like a regular V8. I like the idea of a resonance chamber but it still seems like a big speaker.

So why not actually amplify the sound of an EV motor? People for a long time have been able to diagnose ICE problems based on the exhaust sound. The sound and rhythm changes depending on how fast you're going. You can actually tell a lot by the sound alone. An EV sound would be VASTLY different, but think of the things this could do for EVs in the car community.",2024-06-28 14:22:55

First, if you live in a place with a high fraction of renewables (CA is 50%), a single person driving an electric vehicle is far more efficient than any other option, even city Bus or Metro. With the average US grid (20% renewable), two passengers is more efficient than taking a Bus. Even in West Virginia (90% Coal), Electric cars beat the average passenger car by 30%.

1dpi1kj,China and EU tariffs issue.,"I came across some interesting (and somewhat alarming) news that could have significant implications for those of us investing in electric vehicles (EVs). China has recently warned the EU about a potential trade war over the proposed tariffs on electric vehicles. This comes at a time when Germany's economy minister is visiting Beijing, and tensions are rising.

Here's the kicker: German exports to China have taken a nosedive, falling 14% in May compared to last year, while U.S. exports to China are on the rise, up 4.1%. This shift is so significant that U.S.-German trade volume has now surpassed that of China-Germany for the first time in eight years.
The strained trade relations could potentially impact the German automotive industry, which is already navigating the rocky transition to electric vehicles. Trade experts are suggesting that economic and political factors are increasingly favoring a stronger U.S.-German relationship.

Given these developments, what do you all think? How might this evolving trade landscape affect the EV market and the stocks within it? Could the EU-China trade tensions create more opportunities for U.S. EV companies at the expense of European ones? Or will it lead to broader market volatility that impacts everyone?

I've read a lot about preconditioning the cabin and how helpful it can be for increasing range. However, in my experience using it to combat Florida heat, it has not been overly useful. Should the preconditioning include A/C? Or just the fans themselves circulating air? outside of the preconditioning, the A/C takes a few minutes of driving to really crank on but works great and cools quickly once it does.

I noted that I only did it when it was low and that again, I would be willing to pay for all charges associated with it. He said it is an issue of cost and that the building would have to pay for it and that if other tenants were to use the outlets that would be the same situation.

1doc6h4,First RaceTrac EV Charger in GA Failed - Why most chargers aren't covered,"This is very inside baseball but hopefully some find it interesting that [RaceTrac failed to get approval](https://youtu.be/d_G4ewQDYtc?t=2162) (35:33) for their first EV charger in GA. Unless you live in Alpharetta, GA I urge you NOT to contact the city about this matter, it's only an example and probably isn't the first such case, just the first one I've run across. Local cities have the right to elect officials and build their city as they see fit.

The only reason the city is involved is because they, like most cities, have rules about constructing structures like a canopies and signage. Most people don't know it, but the city determines basically everything about how a business looks right down to the plants in the flower beds to the shape of the parking lot to the mulch color, etc. RaceTrac went through all this when they built the station but now that they want to build an addition, they are right back in the process and have to clear the city again for basically everything. If they were just adding 4x EV chargers they wouldn't need approval from the city.

Chargers don't have covering for the following reasons:

* The process isn't cheap
  * Lawyers, design, engineering, landscaping, code
  * No clue what the actual cost is, but if you told me just the canopy cost $500k I wouldn't call you out on it.  These are all bespoke structures based on each location's requirements.
* Incompatible with canopy zoning codes.  
  * In Alpharetta and most cities you can only have one canopy per business.
  * You can get an exception but it appears that Alpharetta isn't going to be giving those for EV charging which is the result of the hearing linked above.
* Incompatible fuel type with gas pumps 
  * The National Power Protection Agency has rules.  
  * Must be 20 feet from the end of the closest gas hose reach. 
  * I guess so a mad man can't spray the EV chargers with gas?
* Matching exiting structure heights.  
  * Typical gas canopies are 24 feet clearance 
  * RaceTrac appears to be willing to build EV canopies as low as 15 feet if needed 
  * The stations themselves are apparently a bit lower than 15 feet sight line but it's not clear?
* Incompatible with sign zoning 
  * Most cities only allow single sign per business
  * This is a pretty good rule in general and probably not what lost them approval",2024-06-25 17:52:50

--big step up on interior build quality and finish, along with more modern tech. this is a big step for the German cars but probably still behind some other brands. The fit and finish was very high quality.

--space in the back seat is a big improvement over current macan

--rear storage good. frunk storage usable but much smaller than the taycan

--car looks and feels larger than the current macan

--the front end, with the split lights, not sure I'm a fan, but the rest of the design looks great. They had 7 of them in different colors and the car looked good in all of them. The wheels, the aero wheels are ok (and efficient) but the RS Spyder wheels are much better looking

--performance. the car hauls ass and corners on rails. And I think feels faster than (I rode in the turbo) the spec indicates. On handling, it drives WAY better than the current macan. it feels flatter, more agile, and more sports oriented, but with a suppleness in the chassis that is missing from some of their sports cars (which feel over sprung). The chassis calibration and suspension tuning are a big step up from current generation macan, and borderline as good as the Taycan is. This will be a fantastic driving car.

--driving position, control feel. Well, I didn't get to drive it (pre production cars), but, the driving position, wheel. seat, controls are all perfect. you can really sit lower in the car, and the seats (these were the sport plus seats or whatever the high bolster ones are called) are fantastic. Also, entry/exit is much better relative to the taycan which has the b pillar annoyingly forward to the seat so you always drag on it getting in. 

Anyway, I encourage anyone who is in this market to take a look, it's a really good car.",2024-06-25 15:16:43

I also noticed that my cable does not lock when I lock the car. What I mean is, I lock the car and I am still able to pull the cable off, which is not supposed to happen.

People lose their minds when waiting for a charger and etiquette soon goes out the window in favor of aggressive positioning, honking and arguments. 

Why do the charging apps not allow a ""take a ticket"" function at charging locations? You take a ticket in the app you get a notification when it's your turn (along with the bay ID or location). The screen on the charging point could display to others that only the next car in-line can use the station and prompt others to ""take a ticket"" and go park up somewhere nearby. Bonus: parking well away from the charging stations leaves drivers plenty of room to drive and and drive out of the bays.

TLDR From what I can see, heat above 83f or so can degrade batteries and charging in the heat is similarly  unwise.

I've been keeping my battery between 60-80% and, due to working from home, I only need to charge about every 2 weeks.  I'm still using the level 1 charger than came with my car.  A few weeks ago someone emphatically told me that I should let the battery go lower before charging - i cant remember why - but I decided to let it get a little lower.  I usually charge after my sunday grocery shopping, and the car was below 50%, but the temps were going up to 97 and wouldnt drop below 80 until well after my bed time!  

Today is a little cooler, it should drop below 80 by 8 pm, so I plan to plug in tonight and unplug around 9 am.  That wont get it up to 80%, because I'm at 43%, but its enough for a while. 

Is anyone else altering their charging behavior due to the heat wave?",2024-06-24 15:16:36

5) what’s the weight distribution like? Is it close to 50/50?
6) it comes with maxxis branded tyres are they good? Especially under wet hard breaking conditions? Is it good for highway speeds? Where we live weather rarely goes below 0c so we don’t buy winter or 4 season tyres.

1dmtfda,Hertz EV Manager’s Special Experience ,"Attempted to rent an EV at Hertz at San Diego airport and had a poor experience. They had two booking options: 1) a Bolt ""or something similar"" or 2) ""EV Manager Special"". I selected the manager special because I didn't want the Bolt (have one and know fast charging is lacking). It was more expensive so I deduced I would get something more premium like the Polestar 2 or Model 3. When I arrived at the counter they told me they only had Bolts whether you selected a Bolt or manager special and then later corrected that they did not have any EVs available. I specifically rented from Hertz because I wanted an EV and was able to select one for my confirmed booking. Unfortunately, I was not able to do so. 

I asked about EVs in general and the attendant said it's been a nightmare: people who ha e never driven an EV don't know where or how to charge, they don't have chargers at Hertz so you have to return it 85%+. For something like a Bolt, that would suck on a trip. The attendant was nice was upgraded me to Gold but still was bummed I couldn't get an EV as I purchased. 

Obviously EVs as rentals is too soon for the US but it's important to note rental companies also don't know how to properly rent them (fast charging EVs only, chargers at the depot, clear communication on how to charge, EV available if booked, etc.).",2024-06-23 18:59:27

I have a Tesla wall connector (TPN: 1457768) with 18' cord and NACS/Tesla plug set up in my garage that I have never  used (I bought the house with it and the Rivian will be my first EV). I assume the Tesla wall connector works considering it has a light on, and I know the previous owner was meticulous, especially with his cars.

However, The cord is not long enough to reach where I plan on parking the Rivian. The cable won't reach regardless of how I park. Parking in the other spot is not an option because of the size of the spot and the garage layout (stairs going into my house). I understand my options for at home charging are as follows:

1.  Replace Tesla wall connector with another wall connector (Tesla, Emporia, Rivian Wall Charger, etc.) that has J1772 and a longer cord. My hesitation is that this is the more expensive approach, and wont provide me with an adapter to use at NACS charging stations. I'm not sure if my Rivian comes with a NACS to J1772 adapter. How do I go about requesting one from Rivian assuming the R1S does not come with the adapter?
2. Purchase a NACS to J1772 adapter, and purchase an extension cable (Lectron, A2Z, etc). This appears to be the cheaper and easier approach. Are there any issues with connecting the Tesla wall connector into an adapter, and then into an extension cable (or vice versa)? Can this damage the R1S, or reduce charging performance? Am I at risk of voiding warranties and/or being liable if something does happen?

I will be in the market at the end of the year but I'm thinking about getting a charger installed now, before getting the EV, thus before I know where the plug would be.

The panel in my garage is in the fall wall opposite the garage door.  The estimates I got were that to install it next to the panel there would be the cheapest, rather than running 6 or 8 gauge about 20-25 feet.

But EVSEs can come with their own cables so it should be able to reach the EV regardless of where the port on the car is?

Or is there an advantage in spending more to install the plug or the EVSE as nearest to the EV charging port as possible?

Also the plan was to install a plug but I've heard the it's better to hard-wire the EVSE.",2024-06-23 16:48:41
1dmp1jp,Public Charger Maintenance?,"I've always wondered, when it comes to maintaining the units, is it on the provider of the unit to cover the cost or is it the owner of the lot or both?

I live in San Diego so we have a pretty sizeable number of stations from all different companies around. But I've also noticed while some new stations get installed, older stations go down and just rot. There doesn't seem to be any incentive for whomever is on the hook to fix them and in some cases when they do, it could take months to ""get parts"". 

One collection of EVGo chargers by my apartment have been down for a month now and when asked about it, they said that it's taking a long time to get parts because the units got vandalized and that they're taking time to figure out how to prevent that from happening ... Which I mean realistically there isn't a way. Vandalism of the chargers just seems to be something that happens. I think I've seen it worst with Chargepoint units and people snapping off the clips, but yeah.

Anyways, for a state that's so hard up on getting everyone switched to EVs, doesn't seem to help when no one seems to be incentived to keep them running.",2024-06-23 15:44:44
1dmnqgg,PHEV - they are great...But,"The BMW i3 with the generator is one of the best EVs ever designed.  All benefits of EV no range anxiety.  It's A full EV with a supplemental generator. Every(almost) other PHEV is like a Prius.  It's a Regular car with an EV motor attached to the drive train to assist the gas engine.  This design sucks because of increased complexity and points of failure.  In the i3 the 700cc 2 cyclinder moped motor used to charge the batteries could fail and the car would still work fine.  A Toyota Prius is pretty bulletproof but if it has an engine issue you're stuck.  Or you could end up like my brother we who bought a used Escape hybrid and had to scrap it because the tranny was uncommon unreliable and too expensive to fix.

Most of these PHEVs have a silly amount of EV range 20-40 miles.  This will almost guarantee you'll need to use the gas engine often.  In the i3 we barely use the Generator.  It's like 1x A month maybe.  My wife has never been to a gas station since 2017. If they added more battery these PHEVS would rarely use gas and the owners would be very happy.  I suspect many cars are designed this way because traditional manufacturers are already equipped to make normal ICE vehicles with tranny and adding a bit of battery is very easy.  You would not never design a car company from a scratch to make a Prius PHEV you'd make a i3 style unless batteries were ridiculously expensive which they used to be. 

Fortunately the new Ram Charger will be designed this way.  Many non beleivers will realize the amazing real world use cases this truck has and it will blow away Ford, GM and the silly Cybertruck which I actually would love to buy if it was 5x cheaper. I think a bunch of new Chinese PHEV are designed like their also.  It would be great if they make it to the states but who knows.",2024-06-23 14:45:00
1dmnowx,Feeling like an idiot once again (sub 30k non-Bolt EVs in USA),"Before you get on me about the title: the Bolt and used EVs have never left my mind. I am not including the EV rebate that will probably be gone or worthlessly small by the time I can properly afford the one I want. I’m talking about what feels like borderline bait and switch tactics on the part of Chevrolet and Tesla.

Years ago, I got excited when you-know-who announced they were aiming to have a barebones Model 3 that would come in under $30k. My hopes were then dashed when one or two of the lowest trims were removed, putting it squarely in $40k territory. Probably for the best, as I would’ve been selling it in the last few years due to how he’s acted.

Then the Equinox EV was announced with the lowest trim being $30k. Great, the ICE Equinox I test drove checked all the boxes for me! Combined with the EV tax credit and a trade in, I should have identical payments to what I was making on my current car prior to payoff. Oh, what’s that? Starts at $44k? Silly me. I thought I could take advantage of Chevy loyalty bonuses without getting a car that’s the same height as my current one, so I wouldn’t get stabbed in the eyes by as many LED headlights.

I know they should get cheaper with time, but those two incidents just felt like gut punches.",2024-06-23 14:42:57

1dks57o,Taking the Plunge: My First EV Road Trip from Memphis to Chicago,"**~Taking the Plunge: My First EV Road Trip from Memphis to Chicago~**

I recently embarked on my first major road trip in my BMW i4 eDrive35, a journey from Memphis to Chicago and back. This is my third EV, but my first BEV. My first PHEV was a Chevrolet Volt and my second was the BMW 330e. Living in a rural area north of Memphis, I’ve been hesitant about going fully electric because of the lack of reliable infrastructure. I decided to take the plunge into a fully electric vehicle earlier this year and finally had a chance to test it out on a road trip earlier this month.  I was excited but also a bit apprehensive about how the trip would go. Would I have enough range? Would charging be a hassle? I'm happy to report that the trip was a success, and I learned a lot along the way.

**Link to** [EV\_Roadtrip\_Memphis\_Chicago\_2024](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12icisXSbxjLyaX2pk6bu0swJaVrlPbL3FBaicjKo_gw/edit?usp=sharing)

**Charging Strategy**

Going to Chicago I planned my own route using ABRP and the EA app. I wanted to make the most of the free 30-minute EA charging available. On the way back, I relied solely on the BMW navigation, which included two EA stops, one Tesla supercharger with magic dock, and one Chargepoint.

**Charging Challenges**

While most of the charging stops went smoothly, there were a few hiccups. At some Electrify America stations, I encountered broken chargers and had to wait for a charger one time. 

I also learned that driving at higher speeds significantly impacts range. On my return trip, I coasted into the first charge stop with 3% state of charge. This was my own fault because I followed the flow of traffic leaving Chicago, which was well above the posted speed limit of 70 mph. 

It took a LOT longer for the trip than if I’d been driving an ICE vehicle (12 hours vs. 9 hours predicted). This was due to more frequent stops, not because the stops were that much longer. I didn’t really mind because it gave me ample opportunity to use the restrooms, grab a snack, stretch my legs and talk with fellow EV enthusiasts at the charging stations. 

**The Joy of EV Road Tripping**

Despite the longer drive time and one uncomfortable range anxiety episode, I enjoyed my EV road trip. The quiet and smooth ride of the EV, coupled with the pure joy of watching the car practically drive itself thanks to DAPP, made for a relaxing journey. The frequent charging stops made the trip seem less rushed and more peaceful overall.

**Tips for Fellow EV Road Trippers**

* ~Be patient.~ Driving an EV on a long road trip is not for those “Cannonball Expressers.” It’s going to require more frequent stops and those stops will take a little time. 
* ~Speed matters.~ The only issue I had with range was when I was going way too fast following the flow of traffic out of Chicago. 
* ~Don’t overthink it.~ Plan your route carefully if that’s something you’re into, but don’t sweat it too much. I had a detailed plan for the route going to my destination (using EA only) but relied completely on the BMW navigation for the route back. It was nice to get the free EA charging, but even with the one Tesla and one Chargepoint stop on the way back, the cost wasn’t too much (around $10 total). Besides, it’s nice charging at someplace other than a Walmart parking lot, which is where most EA chargers seem to be located. 

**Conclusion**

My first EV road trip was a learning experience, and it was also incredibly rewarding. It showed me that with a little patience, EV road trips can be a fun and sustainable way to travel. If you're considering an EV, don't let range anxiety hold you back. Take the plunge and hit the open road – you might be surprised at how much you enjoy it!

Total kW gained: 45kW

Cost: $0

End State of Charge: 79%

Predicted Range: 211

Departure time: 1845

Notes (amenities/issues): 

* Predicted range went down from 20% to 15%. This may have been caused by falling temperatures (80 degrees to 50 degrees) and/or heavy traffic driving through Chicago.
* There are no facilities at this location; however, there are a few restaurants and stores within a short walk. 
* This was the only station where I waited on the charge because I wanted to get as much charge as possible for the week, and I only used the restroom; did not go into a store or restaurant.
* This is only 10 miles from my final destination. I could’ve easily skipped the final charge, but wanted to be prepared for the following morning, when I had plans to travel back into Chicago for some sightseeing.

**End Location: Great Lakes, IL**

Odometer: 4173

Date: June 8, 2024

Time: 1924

State of Charge: 76%

Notes: 

* The total time for the trip was 12 hours, 24 minutes. This seems like a lot longer than the 9 hours, 8 minutes predicted, and it is. Part of this (maybe 30-45 minutes) was due to traffic in Chicago; another 30 minutes or so was due to the final charging stop, which I could have skipped. 
* Compared to driving a gas-powered vehicle I stopped at least one, and maybe two extra times. I never felt like I was wasting time and appreciated the more-frequent stops.

End State of Charge: 88%

Predicted Range: 194

Departure time: 1115

Notes (amenities/issues): 

* This was a lower range than I’m comfortable with, but I know there’s a little range beyond what is predicted. I did receive the “Engine Power Reduced” message. 
* Speed matters. I followed the flow of traffic through Chicago, which was a good margin above the 70 mph speed limit.
* I stopped about 30 miles north of this charging stop at a rest area to use the restroom. 
* Met a nice couple who knows a lot about EVs. They were driving an iD.4, and their other vehicle is a 2023 BMW i4. They’re thinking about trading in the i4 for a PHEV BMW 330e, to make road trips a little easier and faster.

* Prediction was expected state of charge: 20% and end state of charge was 20%. 
* 2 of 4 dispensers unavailable. I waited for a Hyundai Ioniq 5 to finish charging and then used that dispenser.
* I chose to leave early because I wanted to try out the Tesla supercharger in Marion, IL. I also had enough to get me to my final charge, if needed.

Notes (amenities/issues): 

* Predicted state of charge was 40% and this was what I arrived at.
* Download and preload payment on the Tesla app. Follow the instructions (esp. Push the button, wait for 2 seconds, and then lift and pull).
* This place had the nicest amenities (as opposed to Electrify Americas at Walmart. Nice gas station with clean restrooms and windshield cleaning available at the gas stalls).
* There was a “communication error” about 10 minutes into the charging session. I disconnected and reconnected with no further issues.

Notes: Expected state of charge was 20%, but I made it home at 16%. I drove a little over the speed limit of 70 mph during this last leg of my journey. 

Final thoughts: It takes longer and there are more stops in an EV. I don’t mind the additional stops, because at my age, I appreciate being able to go to the restroom every 2-3 hours (at a minimum). I rarely felt like I was “waiting” for the charge. It was nice to have the car charge while I used the facilities, ate something and stretched my legs.",2024-06-21 01:29:47

1dkocya,"After going back to ICE, I miss having an EV...","I had a 2023 Tesla Model Y Performance for almost a year and decided to sell it at a big loss and go back to an ICE (Mercedes E350 4Matic) about 3 months ago. While I absolutely LOVE my E Class as it is an all around excellent and luxurious vehicle, I really miss having an EV more than I thought I would... (although I don't miss having a Tesla). 

The reason for selling my Model Y was just horrendous build quality and very sub-par experience with the service center and them outright refusing to fix any quality issues. All the small things that I didn't like about the car started to pile up (creaks and rattles, horrible ""auto"" wipers, no Apple CarPlay, no blind spot monitoring, etc). I come from luxury vehicles, and tbh the Model Y didn't feel like a huge step back, but the rattles and missing features I was used to really bothered me more than I though it would...

The Tesla was my first EV and I had a fast charger installed at home, so using it was very convenient. It did kind of suck in the winter time in Michigan as even though it was garage kept, the single digits really killed the range... but at least I was able to top up daily in the matter of 3-6 hours. 

I drive about 1,500 miles per month, so the main thing I really miss is gas savings. My electric bill went up about $100/mo when I had my Tesla, which isn't bad at all considering I spend about $70/week right now on premium gas. Maintenance on an ICE is also a bitch as it's pretty expensive no matter what car brand you get these days. 

The main thing I miss is just being able to drive without having to worry about adding miles to the car as there really is no maintenance or major things that can go wrong to worry about. I also miss the instantaneous power and smoothness of having no actual engine. We're in the middle of a heat wave and the auto-start-stop on an ICE is super annoying, so lately I've been disabling it a lot but really miss how you don't even have to worry about that in an EV as all the HVAC is powered by electric components rather than an ICE engine belt (requiring the engine to remain running for actual heating/cooling). 

I actually really wanted to go into a Benz EQE, but at the time of me getting this E Class they were shockingly out of stock as many people ate them up for insanely cheap lease deals. I was also set on going back to a luxury brand, and didn't really matter to me whether it was ICE or EV.

My E Class is an absolute luxurious tank, and although ICE is a bit more convenient by not having range anxiety or having to worry about charging outside of my garage, I really miss the daily driver practicality and smoothness of having an EV despite the bad EV infrastructure in my state. 

I have this E Class on a 3 year lease and love it so much I'm heavily considering buying it outright, but I will strongly consider an EV again in the future. Sometimes I wish I kept my Model Y and just drove it until the wheels fell off, but I just really wasn't happy with it especially how much I paid for it. 

Loved (and miss) having an EV, but hated the quality of owning a Telsa. Maybe if it was a Model S/X it'd be a different story, but the Y was horrendously built.",2024-06-20 22:26:52

I was driving a wrangler 4xe, and noticed it has an option to turn on max regen breaking. When on, and with a little getting  used to and planning ahead, I barely had to use the brakes. 

Now, my thought is, why not have the manual transmission stick in the vehicle. It wouldn't be changing any gears, but the selected ""gear"" could be used to alter torque output. Also, you could ""downshift"" which would be just increasing the regen amount. To the average driver, it would feel and behave like a manual vehicle, while making use of regen and modified torque outputs. The clutch would just disengage power. 

Another feature could be that it behaves like any other other electric vehicle in an ""automatic"" mode. 

It could switch from PNRDL, to a typical H pattern.",2024-06-20 19:58:04

Wondering why we don’t have a market for vehicles like this? I understand they might not be useful for highway driving across Kansas, for instance, but they seem really great for carrying people and stuff in cities where space is a premium, massive range isn’t as necessary, and an affordable vehicle would be so welcome. Even a Leaf starts at at least $10,000 more than this fully priced for people carrying I believe.

Just wanted to find out if you guys know any apps that allows remote start of Shell chargers? Where I live, there is a new shell station that opened with 2 chargers. That’s the only one near my house and as it’s a fast charger, it’s even better. The rest are miles away, literally 25 minutes to the next fast charger lol. 

I normally use the shell app as it bills me monthly and allows me to manage my expenses etc as I’m self employed. 

However, the shell recharge app has some issues and it’s quite persistent. The other day, another guy remotely charged and when I asked him he told me he doesn’t know as someone else turned it on for me. 

Is there any apps even if it’s an international one that allows for me to enable charge via the app at shell EV stations with monthly tariffs? 

Many thanks 


Edit: bought a new property hence no home charger as I’m getting the entire house and drive way all done. Also will be travelling across Europe, so ideally an app that’s alternative to Shell Recharge, that has as many if not more chargers available in the UK and across Europe, would be ideal.

A Tesla Model 3 is large enough to qualify for the most loose non-truck MPG target which is 42 MPGe in 2024.  No EV on sale in the US is small enough to qualify for the tightest non-truck MPG target which is 55 MPGe in 2024.  If such a car existed it would have a 13mpg\*$140=$1820 price disadvantage owing to its small size.

This difference is set to grow massively, to a 27 mpg \* $140 = $3780 by 2026.  Automakers will not risk making a small EV when the EPA offers so much more compliance credits for big cars.  

The same is true for trucks, which explains the Hummer EV and all of the other giant EV trucks, and the absolute lack of small EV trucks.

I live in an apartment in London so don't have any home charging facilities. Public charging is widely available but it seems extremely expensive. At 85p per kWh, it will cost £51 to charge a 60 kWh battery. With a generous range of 265 miles, it's 19p per mile.

My current petrol car costs roughly £1.38 per litre, and does 45-50 mgp. This works out at roughly 14p per mile.

I'd love an electric car but electricity is more expensive than petrol and I'd have the inconvenience of taking to public charging. It seems EVs in the UK only work if you have home charging and can take advantage of cheap overnight electricity.

I feel this is the reason why EVs aren't more popular here. In countries like China with cheap electric costs and charging infrastructure built for people living in apartments, it's easy to see why EVs are more popular there.

It could get very cold here in winter and I need a vehicle that can travel several hundred kms after after being parked outside overnight and not plugged in  

I compromised and bought 2024 Ford Escape PHEV last week and I have been pleasantly surprised. I have never been a fan of Ford and only had Japanese and Korean vehicles for the last 25+ years. However, after test driving a couple of Escape PHEVs and comparing the prices, I changed my mind. 

The plugin part is awesome, EV mode covers majority of daily driving in the city. I got the base model and it has plenty of features. Without sunroof, there is lots of head room (I am 6’4”). There is no availability issue. The warranty is 8 years on the hybrid components. This vehicle is not the top of the line by any means but at the same time it does pretty good in its category. Everything I checked (fuel economy, features, looks, noise level, roominess, info screen, etc) is decent. I know there are reliability concerns with Ford (I have heard stories from family and friends) but it does not seem like 2024 ford escape Phev is going to be particularly unreliable or anything, hybrid components design is similar to RAV4 Prime.

Here are some dollars and cents. 

All-in-price of this vehicle (MSRP - Ford Escape delivery allowance - dealership discount + tax (12%) - federal EV rebate - Manitoba rebate (I am assuming it will be $4000 if it follows federal rules but no info yet until July)) was $37,500 CAD.

Hyundai Tucson PHEV is $49,700 after tax and federal/provincial rebates. The final price is likely to be higher since this does not include mandatory $2000+ dealership add-on package. So the all-in-price is around $52,000 CAD. Plus there is 1+ year wait for the vehicle.   


RAV4 Prime is $52,500 CAD after tax and federal/provincial rebates. Toyota does not seem to have the mandatory $2000+ dealership add-on packages. The wait is longer though (closer to 2 years). 

Both Toyota and Hyundai vehicles have more bells and whistles than the base Ford Escape PHEV. Hyundai has better warranty, Toyota has better reliability. They are AWD while Escape PHEV is FWD. However, as a mode of transportation, all 3 vehicles are very similar.   


When I look at almost $15,000 CAD price difference between the Ford and its competitors, I can’t understand why there is no more demand for Escape PHEV. especially in colder climates. Am I missing something? Do other people know something about these vehicles that I don’t?",2024-06-19 01:39:46

1ditc96,Changes to Bluedot Charging Program,"Received the following email from Bluedot a few minutes ago. My TLDR of this is it sounds like the 20% charging cash back portion is going away, and instead will be in-app charging only billed to your linked payment method. All points from cash back and referrals are going away.

At Bluedot, we are committed to providing you with the best service possible, and we’re excited to introduce a new feature and provide an update to our existing program. This new addition aims to make your charging experience even easier and more advantageous.

**We've listened to feedback from our Bluedot Card holders and those interested in getting one:**

**Will (BMW i5 Driver):** ""I want to benefit from advantageous charging rates, but can I pay with my credit card?""

**Rose (Mustang Mach-e Driver):** ""I want to complete my charging sessions quickly and conveniently.""

**Ted (Tesla Model Y Driver):** ""Why do I get a debit card to charge my vehicle?""

**What's New with Bluedot Wallet:**

* Easy and Fast Charging: With Bluedot Wallet, you can now complete your charging sessions quickly without the need for a physical card, using your credit card, Apple Pay, or Google Pay.
* Best Charging Rates: Bluedot Wallet users will enjoy the best charging rates available.
* Free Charging Days: Enjoy free charging on special days, ensuring you can charge anywhere.

**Here’s What’s Changing:**

* **Starting July 15th,** our points program will end, and you will no longer be able to accrue or redeem points. 
* **Starting July 15th,** it will no longer be possible to load money onto the Bluedot Debit Card. 
* **Starting August 15th,** Bluedot is discontinuing service of the Bluedot consumer deposit account provided by Piermont Bank, Member FDIC, so your Bluedot consumer deposit account will be discontinued. After this date, any remaining funds in your account will be sent to your address via check.

**To ensure a smooth transition, we recommend that you:**

* Use any remaining balance on your Bluedot Debit Card before August 15th or transfer your balance into Bluedot Wallet from July 15th onward.

1disq17,Authoritative list for state of NACS (aka SAE J3400) adoption?,"Having checked the wiki here to no avail and having come across a few articles that attempt a summary (as of the time of them having been ""published""), I can't find anything that maintains a current & authoritative list of what's been announced and what's been implemented.

I'm not terribly familiar with SAE processes, but perhaps they'd maintain a certification database?

Before I go and burn some time creating one, does something already exist? FWIW, I'd most likely submit it here:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North\_American\_Charging\_Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Charging_Standard)",2024-06-18 14:58:08
1disazz,"I think I am a futurist driver, and I’m having very futuristic experience","I am driving a SAIG Rising Auto F7 (or called MG9 overseas) in China. Currently:

* This is my first car, and even when I was learning with an instructor, I never drove a car with a traditional gearbox (he drove a Toyota hybrid with a THS system), so I don't know what the sense of gearshifting is.

* I can't drive without a 360-degree camera system. I think if it weren't for the 360 system and AEB, I might have hit one or two people riding electric bicycles.

* Since I started driving alone without an instructor, I have always used the automatic parking system to park my car and have never successfully parked it myself.

* My car is equipped with a high-speed ADAS system, but I don't think this feature is very meaningful because it is too aggressive on the highway, which scares me; besides, I still need to operate by myself when changing lanes and exiting the highway. When taking over the vehicle, I often miss the exit due to confusion, so it's better to operate the entire process by myself.

* SAIC has two similar electric vehicle brands: Rising and IM. These two brands seem to be led by two competing executives, so they see each other as their biggest rivals. Unfortunately, Rising seems to be the loser in the infighting, and most of its team members have been laid off. Therefore, I may not get more OTA updates for the vehicle system and intelligent driving in the future. Fortunately, SAIC is a large state-owned enterprise, so I can get basic maintenance and repairs. However, there are only two repair points in the entire Beijing city (with a population of more than 20 million), so even a very minor bump requires waiting for a week for parts.

* I am very satisfied with my Rising F7, and it has received mostly positive reviews in the media. However, due to the failure of internal strife, there is no more media promotion, and now it is basically impossible to sell new cars. We got it a year ago for 270,000 RMB, but now the same configuration costs less than 200,000 RMB.

I’m curious if we’ll see an electric car in the next few years that makes long road trips easy.

Here’s what I’m looking for:
- A battery that stays between 20%-80% (as recommended by the manufacturers, so in practice only 60% is actually useful during a road trip)
- Quick stops under 30 minutes for charging, eating, and bathroom breaks
- Can comfortably cruise at around 120 km/h on highways
- Runs air conditioning and other perks without issues

If EVs can’t do all this, are they really as practical and “peace of mind” for road trips as gas cars?

1di1cwy,My experience with a BMW i4,"Preface: I was involved in an accident in my Model 3, so I got a rental through insurance while it was at the body shop for a little less than a month. At first, I tried renting a Model 3 through Hertz, but the experience was abysmal (dirty, poorly maintained cars). I switched over to Enterprise and ended up with a 2024 BMW i4 xDrive40. I was already considering the i4/i5 for my next car, so I was excited to have the chance to try out the BMW experience.

Rental experience: Enterprise was phenomenal. I cannot emphasize enough how much I appreciate them for getting me into a clean, well-maintained EV without gouging me. They even included a travel charger with NEMA 14-50 and standard US wall outlet plugs.

High points:

	•	Absolutely loved the fact that the trunk opens like a hatch even though it’s a sedan.
	•	The driving dynamics were excellent. The xDrive system had plenty of kick, and the handling felt nimble yet well-planted.
	•	The cabin was comfortable, with excellent fit and finish. The i5 interior is better suited for my taste, but the i4 cabin is nice enough for the price point and the fact that it’s intended to be a “sportier” model.
	•	Efficiency was excellent! I know Lucid is the king of efficiency, but BMW really has a shot at giving them a run for their money once they commit to a dedicated EV platform. I was regularly getting 4.2+ miles per kWh, which exceeds BMW’s estimates by a healthy margin. It seems like BMW assumed that drivers would use little to no regen when they came up with their range estimate.

Drawbacks:

	•	I missed having a front trunk. I’m used to having it, and I don’t understand why BMW couldn’t fit one under that massive hood.
	•	Coming from Tesla, I found the CCS network to be a dealbreaker. Route planning was unintuitive in the BMW nav system, so I ended up planning routes myself with ABRP and PlugShare. When I did try to use DCFS, it was difficult to start and super expensive. A Shell Recharge station I was at took 30 minutes to get started after downloading the right app (instructions on the charger were outdated), loading the wallet, and overcoming communication errors with the charger. It cost $1 per kWh PLUS a $3.50 usage fee. Tesla is far from perfect, but the supercharger experience is a breath of fresh air.
	•	The BMS was actually too conservative IMO. Obviously, I prefer that the range be a bit understated vs. overstated like Tesla, but BMW takes it too far. On my 75-mile drives from Milwaukee to Chicago, I was regularly ending the drive with a higher range estimate than when I started because the battery gauge vastly underestimates the car’s true efficiency. This made it even more difficult to plan routes and charging effectively",2024-06-17 15:49:28

My guess is they’re not desirable because whoever is stealing it wouldn’t want to stop to charge it. Does anyone have the stats on EV auto theft? If it is low, which I assume it is, would this not be a positive to help lower insurance rates? Most people in my area are having their insurance rates jacked up because of all this theft.

1dhnt7p,Car blocks charging after wallbox limit is raised again,"Hey everybody!  
I am trying to write my own central system code for OCPP 1.6 and have come across a problem:  
Once setting the limit such that the charge point stops charging the car, the charge process doesn't seem to start up again. While the limit is too low, the status is SuspendedEVSE (as it should be) but once the limit is raised again the status changes to SuspendedEV. As SuspendedEVSE seems to take precedent over SuspendedEV, I cannot say when the car also changes its availability. RemoteStartTransaction can't affect the charging process. I suspect the car ""goes to sleep"" once the charge process stops. It can be ""woken up"" by unlocking and locking the car with the key fob.  
Is there a way to keep the car ""active"" while the limit is too low? Is there a way to wake it up using the charge point?

1dhn0mm,Will Detroit be reborn as the new Silicon Valley of electric vehicles and mobility transportation? ,"The Ford Motor Company reopened the Michigan Central Station in Corktown last week after being abandoned over 30 years ago. This gorgeous train station has been restored, and along with it, a new vibrant EV technology innovation district in Detroit is being built. This area is being called by most experts in the industry as the new Silicon Valley for electric vehicles and mobility. Michigan Central will no longer host trains but will be a global market-leading hub for advancing new technologies and programs that address barriers to physical mobility.

Any start-up or company that wants to be relevant in this marketplace is going to really need to consider an office or HQ near Detroit. Articles and reports show investors and companies are already doubling down and buying up land in the Corktown Detroit district.

Polestar currently looks like it’s clearing out P2’s for 2025, and is running the cheapest lease special I’ve seen on these (I’ve been interested for awhile but always too expensive). They want 3K down, but with the Costco promo that drops to 1K plus taxes, first month, etc for about $2300 out the door (in SoCal) and 299 a month for both the standard and the hella fast dual motor. (Price definitely jumps if you add performance or other packages though).

On top of that, it’s a no haggle no negotiation thing, you do all the paperwork online. I just test drove one, and put $100 down to reserve the next one I liked coming in a couple weeks, and boom, good to go (assuming the family agrees). I hope I never have to go to a traditional dealership again

1dgmq7j,Mercedes Benz EQA one-pedal driving,"I'm looking at getting an EQA after driving a Polestar 2 for three years. The Polestar does excellent one-pedal driving but when I test-drove an EQA the other day, the salesperson insisted it didn't do one-pedal driving at all. However, I suspect it just didn't have the regenerative braking set up correctly for it. 

At its strongest regenerative brake setting, can you use the EQA largely with just the accelerator pedal?  
  
I was rather shocked by how flicking it into Drive or Reverse would start it moving slowly without touching the accelerator at all! The salesperson said I should control this with the brake and seemed baffled that I was shocked by it, but that's the opposite of every EV I've ever driven.

1dgm1w6,My Full Self Driving Experience (FSD 12.3),"I’d watched many YouTube FSD videos but none of them bring across the visceral experience of using it yourself.

First up was the nervousness … no PANIC … of allowing the car to drive itself. Actually the very first time my wife was driving and decided to give it a try as soon as she reached the parking lot exit. She engaged it and I gulped when I saw the path projection on screen. The car plotted a more direct route than I usually drove, but my slightly longer route was for good reason. So right out of the gate it turned onto an unmaintained, unmarked back road that cut straight through the chunk I always drove around. Amazingly it handled the unmarked back road perfectly. Impressive as that was, it was not my concern. My death grip on the seat was when the car came to the end of the little back road and stopped before indicating an unprotected left onto a busy four lane highway with a divider too small to go halfway. It took a while to get a sufficient break in traffic, but it did it and no one died, although I thought I might have a heart attack.

My wife ended the FSD drive entering a convoluted suburban housing area where we encountered a young mother pushing a baby stroller down the street directly toward us in our driving lane. I wanted to lunge across from the passenger seat when my wife did not take over. FSD automatically slowed way down and carefully steered well clear of mother and stroller.

I asked my wife what she thought of FSD and she said, “I don’t think I cared for it.” As my blood pressure eased toward normal all I could think was I didn’t either but probably not for the same reason.

Much later on a multi-state road trip I used FSD a lot and began to relax into it. The only real issue I had with FSD was it drove like my wife; it kept moving over and cruising in the left lane and waited too long to shift over to an exit lane before aggressively forcing its way over at the last moment.

At our destination in a strange city with poorly laid out roads and inadequate road signs (*okay, it was Knoxville TN*), FSD hit the marks every time, notably in spots I would have gotten wrong but FSD got right. On one night transit my wife was driving again and rejected my suggestion to use FSD. She missed three of the two especially tricky shifts and grudgingly engaged FSD to get us back. 

My FSD trial is now expired but it definitely gave me food for thought.",2024-06-15 16:43:00

A couple of things to note that do influence sales of particular models in Australia: 

We have a thing called a 'Luxury Car Tax'. LCT is applied to cars over $89k (US$58). Basically all BMW, MB and top spec Kia and Hyundai are above the threshold. 

We also have a thing called 'novated leases'. Basically a lease that you can pay using pre-tax earnings. Your employer pays it on your behalf before it gets to your payslip. You would usually have to pay an extra tax to do this called a 'Fringe Benefits Tax, but the Australian government has made EVs under the LCT threshold exempt from FBT. This means you can lease an EV completely tax free.

Again, this makes EVs under $89k even more desirable and would effect sales numbers of higher value models.",2024-06-15 11:52:47

1dg8tjf,Charging in an EV and handicap duo spot,"Location: California 

I was recently charging my car at a Volta station outside a Kohls. Just got done with the gym and was eating my post-workout Chipotle when I noticed two cop cars pull up behind me. Two officers got out and were looking over at my car but never approached my vehicle or me and then just left after a few minutes. I noticed afterwards that the sign states “Electric Vehicle Charging, van accessible” on the sign (honestly didn’t even notice initially). I did also notice a lady about 30 minutes earlier when I had just parked walk up to the sign and appear to take a picture but she never spoke with me. I did some research and it appears that in California, if it’s a charging spot combined with a handicapped spot, charging takes priority? I’m mainly just wondering if I should anticipate receiving a fine in the mail in the next few days and if I do, would I be in the wrong for charging here?

Have had a couple of electricians over and they have asked me if I want 20amps or 50amps.  I assume 50amps is preferable for faster charging.

Anyway, the adapter for the Volvo charger is on the left and the adapter for the Polestar is on the right:

I guess what I am asking is I want the fastest charge I can get so can I plug a 220V 50a charging cable into the Volvo Recharge?

Both electricians said there wouldn't be much benefit to installing the outlet that fits the Recharge adapter but if I go with the other one I want to make sure the Volvo can be charged on it as well.

I assume that it can be, it just won't draw as much power or something, I have no idea how a lot of this works.

1df5apy,"
Petrol car vs EVs charged by a diesel generator.","**Is this assumption true?**

Using a large generator to charge multiple Tesla cars can be more efficient and environmentally friendly than driving a car on petrol, though it is less ideal than using the electrical grid. The efficiency and cost benefits of EVs generally outweigh those of petrol vehicles, even when considering the use of a diesel generator for charging.

I don't have any formula to check it, but I am sure the efficiency should decrease with every lesser charging car.

Is there a border which should be overcome where it starts to be efficient, like 8 EVs at once need less petrol to charge, than 8 petrol cars, all of them drive the same distance.

We could also assume we don't charge a completely empty battery, which is also more efficient.

GPT is telling me it's more efficient, but I am more realistic about physics.

1deerbt,Short German EV Roadtrip (USA perspective),"I recently took a short (2 hours each way) road trip out of Berlin. I’ve driven a couple EVs, but most of my experience is with a Tesla (I have a Model Y). I rented a BMW ix40 from Sixt.

I did a little bit of research. I knew that the EU standardized on a CCS variation, and I knew that they had an extensive EV infrastructure. My research suggested that I could use my credit car (via Tap, or Apple Pay) in most places (a little more on this later). I know that in the US charging outside of Tesla is an app nightmare (I have four charging apps on my phone alone), so I was a little worried but not too worried.

When I picked up the car, I mentioned my slight concern to the Sixt person helping me and they handed me a ShellRecharge card and a QR Code to set it up in the app.

Driving the car in German was delightful. The highway system is excellent, with high quality road surfaces and orderly driving culture. I enjoyed the actual driving experience very much.

They gave me the car at about 60% SOC, and both the car nav and ABRP suggested at least one charge was necessary, I decided to do it on my outbound leg so I wouldn’t have to worry about it on the way back (Sixt offered a “return at any charge level” option standard). I picked a place right off the highway and pulled up at about 46% and realized that this particular charger did not accept debit cards. I became slightly concerned. I tried setting up the app for the charge company, but it wasn’t available outside of the EU region on iPhone, so I tried their website. This also failed, because they didn’t like my non EU credit card.

At this point I was a little concerned, but i had the Shell card so I found one nearby and headed towards it, arriving at about 43%. I started setting up the card and realized that the QR code also pointed to an EU only app, and that the US version of the app doesn’t allow you to add IC cards in that way.

In a last ditch “I otherwise have to turn around and drive back, scrapping the day” move I picked “RFID” from the screen at the ShellRecharge station and held my authed ApplePay up to the reader. To my great surprise it turned green and prompted me to plug in my car. From there It worked perfectly. Charged from 43% to 82% for about 7 euro and was on my way (124kv).

Things I learned: only new installations are technically required to have credit card readers on them, many old stations are app only. This would be fine if their apps worked cross region, but they don’t. When I could create accounts on websites, credit cards often didn’t work.

So my takeaway is: EV charging is *still* sort of a mess even in places where it’s better adopted than the US.

But… that was more of a hiccup and I could have likely avoided it altogether if I had done more research. If I were doing a longer EV roadtrip in the EU I think I’d bring a backup phone set to the EU region just to get charging apps.

Anyone want to share stories of their own out-of-home-country evs, or just tips that might be helpful?

1ddsgu9,US Used Clean Vehicle Credit at point-of-sale is counterproductive,"Dealers have raised their prices on qualifying used cars like the Chevrolet Bolt between $2k and $4k and are just pocketing the difference compared to prior to 2024. Many will list a similar to price to what they had a year ago, but not show that they've inflated the value of the car and are assuming every potential buyer meets all the requirements for the $4k credit. Some do have it shown somewhere on their website, but many do not.

One somewhat anecdotal example here is [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BoltEV/comments/17yl1pm/would_you_buy_a_buybacklemon_bolt_ev/) from 2023. The redditor was looking at a 2020 Bolt EV LT (loaded with packages) with 46,999 miles for $11,874. The redditor also linked the dealer's website. Similar Bolt EV's (with branded titles) from that dealer there now have a price of around $15k.

The [Used Clean Vehicle Credit](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/used-clean-vehicle-credit) has several requirements that not everyone is going to meet. Those who do meet those requirements may get *some* discount if the dealers in their area haven't all raised prices by $4k, but the dealers are pocketing a significant share of that. For those who do not qualify (likely due to already claimed a clean energy credit in the past 3 years or make too much), all of those vehicles are just $2-4k more expensive than they were last year.

I think that pushes used EVs prices across the board up some amount, but it especially pushes up those vehicles that qualify for the credit. This gives many consumers incentive to buy the non-US made used EVs that don't have prices artificially inflated as much. Seems counterproductive.",2024-06-11 23:31:42

One major  part of the story stood out, exactly what all that wind tunnel testing really was and the claim they could have built the car last October even though everyone knows they did not have all their suppliers lined up let alone parts ready to make the bodies. 
   
(snip from article) 
-----
 Aptera told investors in a July 2023 video that it had validated the aerodynamic design of its three-wheel car at a wind tunnel in Italy. It presented the results as proof of its progress. 

But the trip to the wind tunnel was mostly a chance to crank out another advertising video, according to people familiar with the trip. 

Aptera spent only a few hours at the tunnel, which wasn’t designed to test three-wheel vehicles such as the Aptera, which is classified as a motorcycle, the people said.

In an interview, Co-Chief Executive Chris Anthony said the company got an invitation on short notice to use the wind tunnel and decided to use the opportunity as best it could. 

 “We didn’t have time to coordinate with them or talk about, you know, the special needs of a three-wheel vehicle,” Anthony said. “And certainly we didn’t write them a big check, so they didn’t have a lot of incentive to say, ‘Hey, let’s customize the wind tunnel for these guys.’” 

“But we got pretty pictures,” he said. 

Anthony told the Journal that his description of Aptera’s progress was accurate. Aptera was still sourcing and improving some components and features but “in October we could have built that vehicle,” he said.

With Fisker on the verge of bankruptcy and Rivian still not meeting financial goals, Lordstown going under, and major manufacturers like Ford, GM, and Mercedes are pulling back on EV production; What does the future look like for new-to-market EV companies?

  


Canoo has delivered a handful of delivery vehicles but no private use. Their website still says ""reserve now for late 2023 delivery"".  



Faraday Future claims to have started production on their FF91 over a year ago, but delivered 3 cars last fall and none since? 



Aptera claiming 47k reservations with deliveries to start q2 of 24 (but that means they have 20 days left to deliver 1 car or push back deliveries), and claiming to have the ability to produce 7k per year (so they are backed out 6+ years at max production?). 

  
Alpha Motor Cars producing about 2 dozen theoretical variants but only having one or two prototypes (nothing like putting the cart before the horse).

  
Now with the push for lower priced Chinese EVs coming to the states (despite higher tariffs) whats the chances any of these survive? I really like the styling and ideas coming out of startups like this (compared to the more traditional approach of putting an electric motor into an existing production car), especially things like use of space (Canoo non-traditional interior layout), solar roofs, and QOL innovations not found in large scale manufacturers, but I am concerned with lack of available support should a company go the way of Fisker (I really hope they pull it together because Ocean looks like a great mid-size suv with lots of cool options and great range, but I wouldnt take one for free right now with them having fired the majority of their staff and not knowing if I could ever get a replacement part should one fail or if the known software issues will ever be updated).

1dce6tq,I rented a Mercedes EQS 580 4MATIC on Turo,"As the title says, I just rented a Mercedes EQS 580 on Turo, and I wanted to share my impressions.

To give a bit of background, I'm a car enthusiast. I have owned primarily ""driver's cars"" from the 1990s. E30 BMW, Acura Integra GS-R, that kind of stuff. I appreciate cars from this era for their good blend of ownership experience, driving dynamics, and value. That said, my taste is eclectic, and I've driven a wide variety of cars old and new, ranging from a 1960 MG MGA to a 2015 Corvette Z06. I have probably rented 20 cars between Turo and DriveShare over the years. I mention this because many of my impressions are based on my experience with cars from previous decades, and in the ways those cars differ from a modern car, for better or for worse.

I was intrigued by the EQS and its reputation as one of the more luxurious and better built EVs. I've read a lot of negative opinions about the styling, but personally it's one of my favorite things about the car. I like when manufacturers step outside the box and build a product with a singular purpose - in this case aerodynamic efficiency, even if this means deviating from the usual car proportions. This type of function over form engineering used to be a Mercedes-Benz hallmark, so it's neat to see it reflected here.

Prior to this, my EV experience had been with a Tesla Model 3 as passenger, and as driver in a Polestar 2.

Overall, my impression was of a car that was fun to rent, though perhaps not to own. There are many features to delight you and impress your friends - ""gimmicks"" one might call them. Things like the voice-activated sunshade and customizable light band that goes around the interior are neat at first, but I imagine the novelty wears off quickly. I question what the out of warranty ownership experience would be like owning a car with so many gadgets. Most of my gripes (such as the bunker-like feeling and small glass area) could apply to modern cars in general, and aren't an EV-specific failing. The interior materials seemed nice enough but the design was too flamboyant for my taste, and I found myself preferring the minimalist restraint of the Polestar 2 interior. There were some creaks from the interior when going over sharp cracks that I did not notice in the Polestar.

Anyway, here are my notes on the experience:

-First impression, it's not as quiet as you might think. The A/C fan sounds like a jet airliner taking off. Road and wind noise is less than 2012 Lexus RX350, but not by much. Maybe actually slightly worse isolation from outside ambient noise.

-Seats rather firm for a luxury car. My point of reference is sprung seats on vintage cars, which in my opinion are much comfier. Has large side bolsters that hold you in during cornering.

-Dashboard is high, poor visibility all around. But doesn't matter (arguably) due to excellent sensors and 3D camera.

-Had a scary incident where it slammed on the brakes when in reverse thinking there was something in the way, but there wasn't.

-The cornering is confident with not much body roll. Tires give up easily and start squealing due to 5,500 lb.+ curb weight.

-Ride quality still not on the level of something like a Lincoln Town Car or old Mercedes. Some creaks from cabin when going over sharp bumps. Flush door handles are gimmicky and feel cheap to the touch, though the actual door closure itself sounds solid - no doubt something engineered in.

-Fast, especially at low speeds.

-Self-driving is awesome, really good for commuting. Car can steer itself on highway and change lanes by itself, all you have to do is actuate the turn signal. Also will pace the car in front, and can change how many car lengths you want.

-Easier to use voice control for most features rather than delving into touchscreen. Interaction with radio and A/C is inferior to buttons, takes multiple presses of finicky touchpad on steering wheel to change radio preset, for example, instead of just pressing a button.

I'm sure some of these things like the automated driving will be old hat to those of you used to these kind of systems, but for me coming from 90s cars, they were quite neat. By the same token there were things like ride quality, visibility, and user interface that I think are better on older cars, but again, this is mainly an artifact of modern cars and their greatly enhanced safety and efficiency more than any EQS or EV specific failing.",2024-06-10 05:36:47

1dc8a1v,Making sense of battery health for my use case 100-30 or 100-85,"Hello everyone,
I fully understand that batteries have a finite lifetime and a cycle rate until the chemistry degrades.

I recently purchased a PHEV - the RX450h+, which I drive through the city on my daily commute. A trip to work and back takes me roughly 15-20% charge, so I can do 3-4 of these trips before my car will automatically swap into HEV mode.

I’ve been reading about the battery capacity degrading (mainly with the RAV4 Prime - basically same car), but one thing I have not been able to find a definitive answer to is what is better via some data points.

So, my direct question is:
Is it better to charge from 80/85-100 daily OR from 20-100 every 4 days?

A few notes:
You cannot set 80% limits, Toyota/Lexus don’t charge to 100% anyway, there’s a buffer. Also, this would be on a L1 charger as I don’t really need a L2 for my use case.

Essentially, what would maximize my lifespan and capacity?

Thanks!",2024-06-10 00:09:51

As an EV owner (2017 kia soul ev) I was excited to see larger battery sizes coming out the past 2-3 years but couldn't help but notice they're all tied to SUVs or trucks, which are substantially heavier than sedans/wagons. We have an '07 magnum and thought it would be great candidate for an EV remodel and realized that a slightly longer cab may allow for a 3rd row. 

Wouldn't a wagons larger wheel base allow for these bigger batteries and thus the extended range that consumers are asking for?

China has the manufacturing capacity to supply half the world's cars. And it has its eyes on the United States. While there are already Chinese-owned brands available in the states, including Volvo, Polestar and Lotus, no true Chinese brands have arrived in the U.S. as of yet. Insiders say it's only a matter of time though. President Biden slapped Chinese automakers with stiff tariffs - effectively doubling the price of an imported EV May 2024. However, some insiders say tariffs may not be that effective in the long run, and may even do more harm than good.

1dbttfd,New US and Canadian CCS chargers in May 2024,"**Here are all (\*) of the new US and Canadian CCS (Level 3 fast-charging) stations that rolled out in May 2024,** according to the Department of Energy. You can [get the data yourself here](https://afdc.energy.gov/data_download).

These chargers are suitable for most new EVs on the market, except for:

1. Tesla drivers who haven't bought the official CCS adapter yet. Certain older Teslas need additional work done to accept the adapter.
2. Nissan Leaf owners, owners of the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, and some owners of older cars that also use CHAdeMO. If you drive such a car, see my matching post in [](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaf/).

**Some of these chargepoints will be ""refreshes,""** e.g. the provider replaced them with faster chargers etc. Some may be incorrect. This report is only as good as the Alternative Fuels Data Center data.

**There were 255 CCS charging stations with a total of 606 chargepoints added or refreshed in May 2024**, which is a major uptick in both stations and chargepoints.  For comparison, there were only 226 new CCS charging stations in May 2023, with only 421 chargepoints. Things are trending upwards overall.

Some part of this is due to Tesla Magic Dock stations. Previously Tesla didn't report these to the AFDC as CCS, but now they do. And that makes sense because all CCS drivers can use them.

**NOTE:** most Tesla Superchargers do NOT have magic dock as of this writing (all those shown in this report should have it). I recommend using PlugShare to locate compatible stations for your vehicle.

**(\*) ""What about other Tesla Superchargers? Can't everybody charge with NACS now?""**

It's coming for many makes and models, and for newer Ford models as well as a few other manufacturers charging at v3 and v4 Superchargers is already an option with a free adapter from the automakers. GM should release their adapter this year. But since they are not open to *all* CCS vehicles, this report is not the place for them. Tesla's app provides the best guide to their locations, including locations that work with non-Tesla vehicles.

**Other Notes**

To streamline this post, multi-chargepoint locations are listed with the number of chargepoints first.

For serious trip planning, I recommend PlugShare. But by all means check out these reported new locations and submit reviews on PlugShare, which makes things better for everyone.

If you'd like to know about new chargers along your routes right away, or just prefer not to check this list monthly when new openings are rare in your area, I've set up a free service that provides email notifications as soon as they open. You can [sign up at evpov.com](https://evpov.com/). Or not! I don't really have a business plan here, I built it to help EV owners like myself. PlugShare has a similar feature.

So it’s about the same as gas which is about 3.50 a gallon, which also gets me maybe 30 miles (except im not sure). 

So is the combined just the 30+~30? So I’m still spending about 3.50 per 30 miles since it’s using gas and battery? If I spend 13$ charging last week, plus used a quarter tank of gas, I spent around 20$ for the week which is only slightly less than I spent on my gas car getting 20 mpg.",2024-06-09 13:20:37
1dbs4ni,Level 2 Charge Possible 60 Ft From Home?,"Hi all,

Hoping to dive into the world of EVs looking at a model Y with the credit. Issue is i live in a city and my driveway is behind the backyard in a gravel pit with no electrical. Closest outlet is 60 ft away from car outside that’s a normal 3 prong. Extension cords don’t seem smart for level 2 and I’m not even sure level 1. We drive less than 100 miles a week, so we could supercharge (there’s one 10 mins away) but doesn’t seem smart long term. Just trying to understand what my options are. I’d have a professional install whatever options there is (if there is one)

I was in Norway and Sweden the last week with a V90 Recharge plug in hybrid. 1st stop was trondheim, which has a lot of e.on drive charging stations, which we couldn't use because the app, which apparently is a different one from the central european one, can only be downloaded if you are in a Norwegian network. I downloaded the apk and installed it manually, but by the time i had done that, we were east of Trondheim and never saw a e.on charger again. In Åre we managed to install an app and charge the car at a 22kw charger, but averaged about 5kW. And at the 2nd location we tried, none of the 4 chargers worked.


Now i just arrived in Britanny (France) and got an ex30 (yes, i like volvos). Went for dinner and looked for a charger, it didn't exist. Parked at a 2nd one. 5kwh in 90 minutes. Now i just finished charging at a fast charger, which was great, but again the first one i tried, stopped after around 60 seconds (twice).


Really any tips on how i can avoid this are welcomed. Right now i am using ouest charging to pay and that one plus volvos app to find chargers.",2024-06-08 21:42:23

2. **Quoted vs. Real-World Range:** What was the range you were quoted when you purchased your EV compared to the actual range you've experienced in real-world conditions? Were there any significant discrepancies?

3. **Transition from ICE to EV:** Has the range of your EV affected your feelings about the transition from ICE vehicles to EV?

4. **Satisfaction with Range:** Are you satisfied with the range of your current EV, or do you find yourself wishing you had opted for a model with more range? Would you consider paying more for additional range in the future?

The problem is I'm not certain which metering options are really appropriate for a level 1 EV charger. Will a kill-o-watt handle that load? Are there better options? Are there portable level 1 chargers that can meter as well? I don't want to drop a grand to find out I'm using $20/month.

In a few years when the rest of the building's infra is ready, we'll get a level 2 charger.

Edit: important to note- the condo board does not want me to have this ev charger but the law says if I pay for one they can't stop me (Ontario regulation 114/18 for the win!).

1daszyt,First EV Road Trip - Raleigh to Charleston SC,"Last weekend my wife and I took our first long distance EV trip. We drove from Raleigh to Charleston SC - about 300 miles each way. All things considered not a bad experience, but there were subtleties that I didn’t anticipate.

First was the strong incentive to use Electrify America charge stations, since we have free charges from VW. Florence SC was the best spot to charge, but we found that charging to 80% would have barely got us to downtown Charleston. We ended up ”topping off” in North Charleston on the way down and back. Without EA, we would have avoided at least one pit stop by charging when the battery was closer to 20% capacity (vs 40).

Second was the mental model of charging the battery. “Topping off” to 80 or 90% capacity just feels different from ICE refueling. There’s definitely an unwritten rule of only charging to 80% at a rapid charger, especially when there is a line (more on this in a bit).

Third was the discovery that the charge rate is a two way street, even with CCS. Our ID.4 peaked at 140 kW, but at higher levels of charge slowed to ~75kW. I’m sure the outside temperature of 80-85F was a factor.

Last bit was the waiting time. Both charge points were in big box store parking lots (Wal Mart and Target), so killing time with some impulse shopping during the ~20 minute charge wasn’t difficult. What did drive me nuts was the unreliability of EA charge points. At least one of 4 chargers was out at each stop. And on Sunday afternoon- when charging demand seemed to peak at the Florence location- there were two stations offline. We waited almost 40 minutes because there was a “line” to charge. The experience wasn’t that bad, though. There was a system of sorts and everyone was polite, plus my wife and I weren’t in a rush. It would have been a different situation if we had our kids in tow…

Overall- the pros of the EV vastly outweighed the cons. We decided after this trip our minivan will be the last ICE vehicle we ever own.",2024-06-08 02:58:12

For me, it's the ""EV's constantly catch on fire"" myth, because it's so pervasive, but easily disproven with statistics. There have been many parking garage fires in which an EV was blamed, yet the fire was started by an ICE car or the fire didn't even start in a vehicle but in the garage's structure itself. Some people are so convinced that this myth is true that they will try to prevent EV's from using parking garages, or some HOA's will ban them.

Of course, there is the one gotcha in that improper EV charger installations have caused quite a few electrical fires, but that's not the fault of the EV but the electrician that installed it.",2024-06-07 19:58:56

If the U.S. makes EVs more ac­ces­si­ble and af­ford­able by wel­com­ing duty-free im­ports, en­vi­ron­men­tal­ists will be closer to achiev­ing their goal of get­ting more EVs on the road, con­sumers who want to buy EVs will be able to do so more eas­ily, and au­tomak­ers can fo­cus on mak­ing cars with in­ter­nal com­bus­tion en­gines, which would sup­port auto work­ers’ jobs.

In my area, electricity costs the equivalent of $0.20/Kwh. If the battery of the EV is about 39kwh, does that mean getting from 0-100 would cost $0.20/Kwh x 39Kwh = $7.80? 

If I get a level 2 charger for my home, and it's rated to 7kW, does that mean that it charges the battery in a span of 39kWh/7kW = 5.6 hours? Do I need an electrician to see if my home's circuits can handle it?

Maxell already produces them commercially.,"Also, if power density is much higher than current batteries, even if they cost more, overall, they won't be adding more than a few thousand dollars to the price of a BEV.  There are ceramics (Prologium, Honda), sulfides (Samsung, Toyota), Na-ion, and one other major type.

It remains to be seen if Samsung SDI and Toyota can hit mass production in 2027 but by 2030, I expect these to be commonplace, even if only because of safety factor with reduced thermal runaway risks.

For those of us wanting to buy a new vehicle soon, many BEVs will offer lots of advantages over other vehicles.  Maybe it's even better to lease with the intention of buying out these BEVs if these projected milestones on newer battery chemistries aren't realized.  If they do, then buy a BEV with newer battery technology and keep them for a very long time. :)

Long battery life of 20 years

Maxell’s all-solid-state batteries have a long battery life of 20 years, which was difficult to achieve with existing batteries. As they can reduce the need for frequent maintenance such as battery replacement, they can contribute to infrastructure monitoring in harsh environments and measures against decrease in the working population.

No liquid leakage, explosion, or ignition

There are no concerns such as liquid leakage, explosion, or ignition, so high safety is a feature of the batteries. We also envision use in the medical and healthcare fields where safety, in addition to use in harsh environments, is a requirement.

1d9d2fv,"as China shifts to EVs, dealers forced to offer massive discounts on ICE cars","here's an interesting facet of China's ongoing shift to EVs: even though ICE cars are still the majority of China’s new-car market (latest data for year-to-date: [40.26% are hybrid or EV](https://cnevpost.com/2024/06/05/china-nev-retail-790000-in-may-2024-preliminary-cpca-data/), so all the rest are ICE), overall plummeting demand for ICE is causing chaos with prices.

automakers' official prices (MRSP) haven't changed, but a reliable source of local car-buying data (Yiche.com) shows that dealers across China are giving massive discounts - 35% discounts are now common on once-popular ICE models (see list below) - to shift brand-new ICE cars from their forecourts.

here's a potted list of big discounts in my area of China, using Yiche's real-time local pricing data:

    **MODEL        MRSP   ->  DEALER DISCOUNTED PRICE**

BMW X1 sDrive20Li = US$40k -> US$26k

Mercedes GLB 200 = $43k -> $28,300

Audi Q3 35 TFSI = $38,600 -> $25,100

Toyota RAV4 2.0L = $24,400 -> $17,500

BMW 320i = $41,400 -> $29,700

Lexus NX 400h+ (hybrid) = $59,200 -> $52,200

Volvo XC90 B5 = $88,100 -> $65,100

1d95p06,EVs-Taking the Fun out of Driving? ,"First and foremost, I expect to be heavily downvoted in this subreddit, since my post will seem like I'm smearing and criticizing a segment of a population who ownes or owned Electronic Vehicles (EVs.).

English is also my 3rd language, so if you happen to see grammar and other issues, that just happens with me.

I assure you  I am not, matter of fact I was on the market to buy my first EV, but one issue lead to another and I didn't get one, but also because of very anti-EV sentiments that I came across, when I mentioned buying an e-car. I also brought up buying an EV the first time I've heard about affordable EVs coming out, although I had no desire to own a Toyota Prius, due to how they look, I just couldn't imagine myself driving one of those.

So anyway, I came home with another ICE vehicle as my new car just a few months ago. Yes, I'm stuck in an ICE car for another 5-6 years at least.   Just a few month ago, we had a nice and comfortable evening to sit outside and just talk with friends and neighbors and my purchase of my car came up as a topic .  
Our conversation lead into about cars in general, and then into EVs and ""the issue of EVs"" if I would have to title it.  
I have to say there is not 1 single person I talked to (out of the 6 people) who wants to buy or want to own an EV. I know, sad, but that's the reality.  I do, and my opinion met some criticism, but I have to mention, that it's more like ""I would, if..."" - and there is a list of things I can mention.  Let's call them prerequisites, regarding charging stations and prices and so on.  
These are ordindary people, my neighbors and some other friends, age ranging from 30s to 60s. So I wouldn't even say there is some sort of a generational bias, since it's from Gen Z to Boomers and everything between.  
The reasons vary somewhat from one to another, although all 6 of the people agreed on that there aren't enough chargers around us to begin and because we live in CT- the most expensive electricity in the entire USA isn't really offering as much savings as other states.  You can look this up yourselves, New England as far as energy prices, or just prices in general is more like a black hole and it's surprising that people still live here, if you ask me.   You must have a reason, like a sick family member or an elderly parent or similar, it's certainly not the prices or job opportunities and cost of living LOL!  
Back to the cars, the other things everyone seem to agree is that EV-s don't look or act like a fun vehicle to own.  
As me, the 7th person in the discussion, I agreed with the fact, that nearly all s EVs I come across on my commute is doing 55mph in the 65mph and everyone is passing them all around.  Don't ask me, I don't understand either I said.  They are supposed to be faster and quicker and all that, but if you ask me, these people should've bought a Toyota Yaris or a Nissan Leaf, not a Tesla P51 or \_\_\_\_\_\_ insert any other EV out there that isn't a Nissan Leaf or a Toyota Prius and actually have some torque and power to play around.  
It gives the impression that conserving the most amount battery charge  is the No.1 mission while driving an EV, and this would also include that the segment of the population who buys EVs are mostly those who may not even like driving as a hobby or fun thing to do, but just some annoying part of life, when we need to get from point A to point B, since we can't beam to different locations without any travel, like in Star Trek.

One of the person went as far as being scared to turn into ""one of those people"" who literally drive around in their EVs like the car is made out of tissue paper and drive 10mph under the speed limit (not that you cannot) and pisses off about 95% of all other drivers, again I see this all the time, I know I'm not seeing the same person and there are multiple EV drivers either holding up the passing lane or 18 wheelers ends up passing them in the slow lane, which causes the traffic to be worse, since now the 18 wheeler has to get into the passing lane and of course it cannot accelerate ahead as quick as the rest of the traffic. And all that, is because probably the EV driver is probably looking at his charge gauge or whatever indicator and show that if he keeps going this slow, he can get bonus 10 mile range. I'm just guessing. 

By the way, the title ""taking out of the fun"" doesn't mean that we mess around on the highways and put people into danger, that's not what I'm talking about.  What I'm talking about is that there are fun ways to drive a vehicle and still be following the law.  I take my car on a twisty turny backroad that hardly have any traffic or give it a spin here and there where there aren't anyone around, having some enjoyment of mechanical power. under my butt. I mean, I really dont' need to describe what is fun about cars or why people buy certain cars over another?  
Now, this sort of a ""fun"" either does not exist among EVs, or the people who buy EVs do not buy them for fun?

Or would it be fair to say that EVs in general- are not meant to be bought for driving it for the fun of it, but a more efficient way to travel?  Should we be reshaping our view and understanding of driving that it shouldn't ever been fun in the first place?  Are EVs that are replacing ICE vehicles are here to offer a different perspective of traveling that exlcudes the whatever fun you thought you could have by sitting on a seat with the steering wheel in hand and an accelerator and brake pedal by the foot? If you ask me based on what I see on the roads and EV drivers, that might be the cause, whether they are aware of it or not.  Again, I might only see a portion of EV drivers although CT is a sort of drive-through state really so I see plenty of NY, MA, PA, NJ, VA, FL and pretty much every state driving through here (usually heading to somewhere else BUT here).",2024-06-06 00:46:31

To explain car, even when on brake or just lightly on move just suddenly moves very fast. People keep saying it might be mixing up breaks etc but I also use normal car regularly that never had similar issue. 

We talked with Volvo, they told us they tried to simulate same situation in their base but they didnt have that ""sudden jump"". They even changed computer system of the car. 

Just half an hour ago it happened again and we got deeply afraid as this happened while parking and you know how some people like to walk behind cars so I almost had a mini stroke honestly. 

What should we do? I think we tried everything but Volvo refuses to accept such thing is happening. 

Its especially severe with Twin version. I was wondering if anyone else is living through same thing.

I am concerned that I will buy a car because of the current feature set, and then in the year discover that a feature that sold me on the car is gone - whereas now it can go from 0 to 60 in .1 seconds faster, which I could care less than nothing about.

I believe Ford's Blue Cruise can do full self-driving more or less with a subscription, but if you don't pay for it, a Mach E will still keep you centered in your lane and take care of the cruise control. And of course the Kias and Hyundais will do all that for free from day one.

1d8iw0z,Thoughts on EVs from a Former Skeptic ,"I've never been ""anti"" EV persay, more just skeptical of their environmental benefits, and not impressed from a value perspective compared to gas cars. I also saw the range inconveniences on long trips as a quality of life downgrade, just another small example of enshittification that seems to be so common in this 21st century. I still think some of these things are issues (especially the cost thing, and especially in the long term due to degradation of the battery), but my overall attitude toward EVs as general transportation is one that is now very positive, and I think they are the future.

Two things mainly swayed my opinion. The first--and I'm embarrassed as a car guy that it took direct experience to realize this--is that I got to drive my cousin's Polestar 2 in the Bay Area during a visit. The seamlessness of the experience and the smoothness and lack of NVH really sold me. For the type of commuting driving that most people do, I really think the EV experience is superior.

Of course, there is the tactile, sensory experience that you get from driving a good gas car (preferably one from the 90s or before, before the regulations kind of sanitized everything) that has an appeal all its own. There's a whole sensory experience to shifting the gears and piloting a lightweight car through a set of curves with an exhaust popping out back that an EV will never be able to replicate. If that's what you're into cars for, there is no substitute. For everyday use though--99% of the type of driving people do--I think EVs are great.

The second thing that changed my view was going a bit deeper on the environmental impact and realizing that EVs are indeed significantly more eco friendly than ICE cars. I still think the initial manufacturing impact and the fact that they all have batteries that are constantly degrading and have to be replaced is not ideal, but I'm fairly convinced now that they're significantly less polluting than ICE cars, whereas before I thought the difference was marginal.

Am I closer to buying a new EV now than I was six months ago? Likely not, but only because I'm a weirdo cheapskate car nut and only buy 30 year old German and Japanese shitboxes on Craigslist for $5k. An EV simply cannot compete with that value proposition, at least not yet. This is one of the key things I like about gas engine cars--they can essentially be kept on the road indefinitely. They have this buy it for life appeal that I'm not sure you will ever have with a car that has a disposable battery pack. I'm not looking forward to the day when a car is like a phone, and you're forced to buy a new one--or replace the battery at great expense--every 15 years or so. 

Overall, I think EVs are going to be awesome for their intended use case, and I think the world will be a better place with more of them. I would like to see a longer usage horizon and less disposable attitude toward vehicle consumption though, and for prices to come down considerably.",2024-06-05 06:05:10

1d7ky93,Denied Massachusetts Point of Sale Rebate,"Hi everyone,

I’m scheduled to pick up my Tesla Model Y this Saturday in Massachusetts and I’m encountering an issue with the EV rebates. I qualify for both the federal and Massachusetts state EV credits at the point of sale. However, I have an out-of-state license (Maine), even though I am a resident of Massachusetts.

Here’s a breakdown of my situation:

•	When I placed my order, I uploaded my Maine license.

•	Tesla is now saying they can’t give me the Massachusetts rebate at the point of sale because of my out-of-state license.

•	According to the Mor-EV application guidelines, I should qualify for the point of sale rebate if I provide my out-of-state license along with a utility bill or proof of residency, and if the purchase is made at a Participating Dealer.

•	Tesla Dedham, where I’m picking up the car, is listed as a Participating Dealer on the Mor-EV website.

•	My Tesla advisor claims they can’t process the out-of-state license for the rebate because the Tesla location is not a “full service RMV”.

I’m confused about this situation. From my understanding, Tesla Dedham should be able to submit the rebate application on my behalf, and I don’t see what being a full-service RMV has to do with the rebate application. Does the dealer have discretion on whether or not they can approve or deny the rebate?

Has anyone faced a similar issue or have any advice on how to resolve this? Any help or insights would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

I was able to go to the RMV today and transfer my out of state liscence to Massachusetts. They gave me a temporary liscence which Tesla said they could process for the rebate at point of sale. ",2024-06-04 01:12:47

1d7ifsm,What happens if a supercharger (or two) on a major highway go down completely?,"We're planning our first major road trip in our Tesla, and along some of the routes through sparsely populated western states, there's a string of superchargers along the highway, but it seems like basically just enough to keep cars charged as they travel along the route. Probably nowadays there are hundreds of Teslas traveling along these routes every hour.

What happens, though, if one or two Superchargers become unavailable. Could be some outage, or even vandalism/theft if someone steals the cables on all the chargers or something.

Would there suddenly be a 'pileup' of Teslas on road trips stuck and unable to continue their journey? Has this ever happened? Am I being overly paranoid?

EDIT: This seems to have been interpreted as an anti-EV concern troll. It's not - i'm sorry if my genuine concern is interpreted as idiocy or as having an ulterior motive. Personally I don't think it's an unreasonable thing to ask about - it seems like a single point of failure issue. The genuine answers that are actually reading the question (remote parts of the west, with a single major highway) are basically saying ""This is not a problem because it's super unlikely to happen (99.x%  uptime)."" In my interpretation, if it did happen, it would be a mess (I don't think there are enough non-Tesla fast chargers in rural South Dakota to handle all the Teslas on I-90 that need to charge), but I accept that the likelihood of it happening is extremely low.",2024-06-03 23:10:19

Basically it would take a tripling of renewable energy production just to cover car consumption too (disregarding yields), which would also require infrastructure and energy storage solutions.

I'm starting to understand why many in Germany don't view the full electrification as realistic in the next decade. To me it seems like it's either down to reducing total consumption or importing energy, which may well continue to be in fuel form. Thoughts?",2024-06-03 17:34:22

1d6zwlu,I went to the auto show at Shenzhen(where BYD HQ is) yesterday,"I want to share some of my experience here. Also apologized for not being a good photographer so I didn't take much photos, some cars will be described in text only. There were 7 exhibition halls and BYD had one exclusive hall, and WOW there were so many EVs and brands that I have heard or never heard before.

Lets start with my most impressive cars, the Denza Z9 GT. Man this thing is such a beauty! Watch this car in real life feels totally different from video and rendering cg. Not need to mention it's an absolutely beast, 3 motors about 1,000 hp in total. Looking from sides it remind me the Panamera Turismo but different aesthetic. The front and side design are actually really different with Porsche's design language, feels less sporty but more elegant. I somehow prefer the front looking of Z9 than Panamera.

[Z9 GT](https://preview.redd.it/wkz6cjmb9b4d1.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5db26ac6038bd0bc9caa946e3a634c5964633f07)

I also took some photos of BYD Yangwang U7 and U9, they all looks cool but I feel they are kinda less impressed? All Yangwang has 4 motors and over 1000 hp and bunch of other high tech but not my type. I also had chance to seat inside the U8 but didn't take photo. The seat of U8 was super soft and comfortable, for the interior, all the place that you can touch are cover by some kind of Alcantara and leather, feels really premium, I don't like it's bright orange color though.

https://preview.redd.it/557vkjw5ab4d1.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f1e30911740e8cdbfca12660873317a936ae2db

https://preview.redd.it/9ytu91w5ab4d1.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b6c71ee98cde41628d92ed50957ed4cf2f3e137f

Sorry for lack of photos here again but my second most impressed car was actually the BYD Leopard 5, a PHEV off road SUV. Outside of the BYD hall there were test ride of it's off road capability and the demonstration of BYD U8's water floating ability(I would like to call it boat test, and it does float on the water, really insane to watching in person despite I've already watch the video online). For the leopard 5 you can seat inside and it's driven by BYD staff. There was a 40 degrees slope and BYD claimed Leopard 5 can climb up to 45 degrees, but 40 degrees was impressive enough. It's almost felt like seating on the roller coaster, half of my body weight was on my shoulder and back instead of butt, such an experience that I never had in a car!

[Edited: I found the picture of exact test ride slope online](https://preview.redd.it/d8kvmieuoc4d1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=524e34efb71153bf24ca1d4a339586033b79b1cd)



Another nice car that I can recalled was the Zeekr 001, sorry for no photos again, there were so many people and I couldn't find chance to take a photo without including other people. The interior feels luxury, and inside was really roomy, tons of leg space for both front and back seat. The seat was soft and comfortable, and it's AWD version can do 0-100 km/h or 0-60 mph like 3-4s. All these cost only 300k rmb(41k USD)

There were so many models and cars that I'm not gonna bother to write a dedicated paragraph but they have some cool features. Like the leopard 3, it's the little brother of leopard 5 but it's BEV and has a integrated DJI drone on top of the car. However I'm not a huge fan of it's weird looking.

1d6rday,Tesla Audible app Review. It is unusable,"Sorry tried posting this on the Tesla specific subreddit but it seems like they are all ran by the same person that auto deletes text reviews. Do not understand that decision.this is the next best place. For me this really reflects the downward direction the company has taken.



I have been utilizing the Tesla Audible application for more than a week, and it consistently fails to resume playback from the point where I concluded my listening session on a different device. Additionally, it does not accurately record the timestamp when I cease listening in my vehicle. When I switch between my car and phone/tablet, the application inexplicably jumps to a random location from the the last day within the audiobook. And the Tesla cat often resumes playback from the point where I last used it in the Tesla cat, it is quite difficult finding the right place again as there is no timestamp or slider just a skip forward 15 second button.

I have attempted various troubleshooting measures, including leaving the application open for several minutes before playing and utilizing a hotspot instead of the car's data connection. However, none of these attempts have resolved the synchronization issue.

Regrettably, I am compelled to rate the application 0 out of 10. Until this critical issue is rectified, I consider the other shortcomings and benefits to be inconsequential. Consequently, I have reverted to using Bluetooth, which consistently delivers reliable performance.

I am uncertain whether this issue originates from Tesla or Audible. Regardless of the source, it does not reflect favorably on either company.",2024-06-03 00:10:32
1d6pirr,Questions about CCS verse NACS.  Thinking about getting electric car next year. ,"I been following the electric car market for a while and I really want an EV. I do a quick question though.  I do have family about 12 hours away and would like to travel to see them once in a while.  Please follow my thought process below. 

1) I know road tripping with a Tesla is extremely easy. Widespread NACS access via Super Chargers and a great app makes it easy (according to videos I watched)

2) by that logic I should either get a Tesla (Elon makes me puke, but the Y makes me interested), Ford (mache is current #1), or Riven (can’t afford one). 

3) this leaves out many great other vehicles though.  Blazer Eav, Equinox (might be my #2) ID4, KIA (many great EVs), or even an EUV. 

4) it seems like CCS is expanding every day while Tesla just gave up expanding their access. 

5) Yes I know about ABRP, but it seems like CCS chargers tend to be less reliable, less widespread, and less chargers per stop. A great example is my local grocery store has 4 CCS chargers and 20 Tesla chargers. 

6) seems like rollout of Tesla chargers being open to everyone is either going too slow or just not gonna happen for some brands. My gut is teller my CCS chargers are pitching to brands to not switch to NACS right now due to Elon actions.  

7)  is road tripping with a CCS getting easier every day? More are working and more are getting installed daily? Almost sounds like the best move is get a Mache since it can use both? 

Edit: would be mostly home charging (level 1) and charging at work (free level 2 chargers). 

Overall I don’t drive too much, work is about 30 minutes away. Will occasionally drive to Chicago and that is about 2:30 hours away from me. 

Learning that Volvo is getting superchargers makes me interested in those vehicles, but they do cost a lot.",2024-06-02 22:41:29

1d6iq0t,Running the numbers between budget EV and hybrid,"[EV Hybrid Comparison spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k1pjTIgYo4nfhJzqTU51JLMg78q_G7tO18ShBceiJcA/edit?usp=sharing)

I was spending the past couple of months running the numbers between owning a efficient hybrid versus a used budget EV. And my conclusion is that unless you have very cheap home charging or consistent free public charging and drive a lot of miles per month, more than 1500. The hybrid is a better choice.

On the calculations for the hybrid, I chose a Corolla hybrid new version. I live in California so the gas prices is around $5 a gallon. I tried to keep the cost of maintenance, insurance, repairs, fuel costs roughly consistent. 

For the EV, I chose a Tesla Model 3 used. Because currently you can get a used evade that cost under $25,000, at least 2 years old, if you qualify, you get $4,000 off. Also with my electricity provider, Southern California Edison, there's an also another $4,000 off of pre-owned electric vehicles if you qualify for the low household income. The cost of electricity is about 33 cents per kilowatt flat rate, and if you use more than 500 kilowatts per month the cost increases to 43 cents. There is also a time of usage rate, TOU-prime, which is 25 cents per kilowatt during off peak hours, but electricity usage during on peak hours which is 4:00 p.m. To 9:00 p.m. Is 63 cents per kilowatt hour which doesn't seem better than the flat rate. 

So in the best case scenario, the upfront cost of the Tesla is significantly cheaper. However the cost per month of ownership is roughly the same and often more than an efficient hybrid, simply due to the fact of high electricity cost, and also very high insurance and renewals fees. Since EV's don't pay for gas they don't pay for the gas tax for road maintenance so the state is trying to put that cost onto the registration fee instead. If electricity costs are low, and you drive a lot per month then it might make sense to get an electric vehicle. But for everyone else a hybrid makes much more sense. 

This also does not take into account that batteries do not last forever, however most car companies offer a pretty long warranty for the battery, 8 years or 100,000 miles. However once the warranty is up, you're out of luck in terms of the battery and you'd have to pay for it yourself. And from my experience from looking online, I rarely see people last that long with their battery, and their battery goes under 70% capacity left. It seems more likely that the high voltage battery just stops working randomly due to bad cells, and stops charging and then people have to get it replaced through warranty, such just a refurbed pack.

So I think that in summary, if you're getting an EV, you are definitely not saving money, unless you drive a lot of miles amount per day, 80 or more. The main justification for buying an EV is because you like the driving experience of electric vehicles mostly, you don't go on road trips often, and you can charge at home easily.",2024-06-02 17:40:55

1d65n4i,Had a really cool interaction with an ICE driver today,"I drive a Kia EV6 and briefly stopped at a park near my house today. The parking lot is shared between the park and a public baseball diamond on the other side and a game had obviously recently finished.

As I'm walking back to my car, I see an older gentleman stopped and staring intently at the back of it. I have a veteran tag and a ""Retired Air Force"" tag surround and I saw he had an Air Force Veteran hat, so I figured it might just be that (randomly, I happened to be wearing a similar one as well)

Me: Pretty good looking, eh?

Him: This yours? I've never seen one of these. Kia is making some good looking cars now.

Me: I agree. This one's actually electric.

Him: Really? How's it plug in?

Me: (unlock car, pop the charging door) I just plug this in when I'm home and leave every day with a ""full tank"". It's pretty great. Told him I got by for months with a ""regular plug in"" Level 1 charger, but have a 240v charger now and we talk about range a bit, what trips I've taken, etc. He mentioned he was from Missouri and was just here (NE Kansas) for the day, but that was plenty to get here and back home.

We end up swapping ""war stories"" (him late 60s Nam, me damn near every war after) while I showed him around the car.

He at one point started to talk about ""oil and all that"" and I stopped him and said, ""Yeah but what really sold me is that I can drive this for about 3 or 4 cents per mile. My old gas car was more like 25 or more. That part's pretty hard to beat"". He readily agreed!

(I didn't mention that I also have solar panels and charge ~95% off excess production for free. I'm not about to try to ""sell"" a likely conservative boomer on solar.)

I'm sure he's not going to run out and get one of his own next week, but it was nice to quash a little EV FUD. Kinda made my day. 😊",2024-06-02 04:56:50

1d5wpnd,Dual LiFePO4 and Li-ion battery modules in a single vehicle,"Every manufacturer uses a single chemistry for battery packs for the entire vehicle. However, it seems like there would be advantages of having some modules LiFePO4 and other modules Li-ion. This is not referring to mixing cells in the same module, but having 50% of the modules entirely LiFePO4 and the remaining 50% of the modules entirely Li-ion. 

LiFePO4: Cheaper, can be charged to 100% and less volatile.

Li-Ion: More energy dense, lighter and faster to charge.

1d5tvt4,How to talk to anti-EV people (if you really have to),"Quite a few posts on this sub about the difficulties of talking to people who are hostile towards EVs, so I thought I would share some tips that I find useful doing so.

First, when entering any kind of debate, you have to set your goals appropriately. The goal should not be that your opponent completely agrees that they were wrong and you are right. For any kind of belief that people are emotionally invested in, this won’t happen. If you try to force it, the other person will just dug in more, no matter how absurd positions they have to take.

A more realistic goal is to be able to get a few good points across, that they can contemplate *later* and move their position closer to yours *later*. For this to happen the discussion needs to remain cordial and respectful. When people feel threatened they will clam up. It is also a good idea to make the other side feel they also made some good points that you will consider.

It is also useful to understand where most anti-EV people are coming from. Most of them would not give a damn about EVs if they were left alone. Instead, they feel that the whole transition is being forced on them. ICE vehicle ban pledges, tax incentives for EVs, Swedish teenagers yelling at them that they are bad people, etc. I think they have a point. If you agree (even if you think this forcing is for a good cause), you should sympathize with this feeling. People in general don’t like and resist stuff that is being forced on them.

So a good opening could be to say that you believe people should not be forced to buy EVs and should be able to make up their mind on what type of vehicle is the best for them. I always state this and it makes the rest of the discussion much easier.

The rest of my strategy is the following:

Step one, come to an agreement on use cases where EVs make a ton of sense. I usually try to have them come up with some of these. Second car in a city. Long range freight with planned routes and charging stops. Taxis, buses, local delivery vehicles. Etc.

Step two, once we identify that a good portion of ICE vehicles can be replaced by EVs, I start talking about who will make these. I ask them if they think China is playing fair in the global economy - most agree they don’t. I then point out that most of the government intervention is trying to counter that. They might come back with a different preference for this (e.g. tariffs or bans). I usually point out that these are also forms of government intervention, and then leave the conversation open on this point. I am not an economist and TBH not sure what is the best approach. At this point we both agree that the government has a role in EV transition, and this was my main point.

Another claim that frequently comes up is that EVs / electricity production hurt the environment too in some form. It is important to understand that these people usually don’t care about this at all. They bring it up because they think you do. So the best strategy I think is to not engage with this. I usually just s say we need to figure out clean energy anyways, and battery tech is constantly changing. I move back the discussion to the convenience, low maintenance and low cost of powering EVs.

I had a lot of success with the above tactics and most conversations ended on a friendly tone. One guy brought a Mach-E two years after I first debated him :)

Anyhow, I hope others find the above useful. Also interested in how others approach the topic?

He thought non conveyed the same feeling of raw enthusiasm as petrolhead.

Well one reason is those names are not in common use so haven’t developed associated feelings.

The other reason is not one included what I would suggest as a powerful equivalent: EV-angelist. Partly because of the evangelist like way many EV devotees preach about the benefits of their vehicles. So I propose EV-angelist or EVangelist as a new term. ",2024-06-01 18:13:10

1d5qalo,GA Power customers: There may* be a way to charge for under $0.02 per kWh at home...,"I'd like to just start the discussion / bounce some ideas and fact check ourselves in effort to get the lowest home and EV energy cost. 
 
There's a smart power plan where you get very low cents per kilowatt hour rates ($0.089 to 0.11 I believe), however you get charged a one-time penalty for a peak demand load. Meaning whatever your highest peak utilization was in kW for that month they multiply that by ~$13 and then add your metered utilization thereafter.

For example your home peaked one time at 15kW x $13 = $195... PLUS your utilization. In the summer obviously this ""smart"" plan is dangerous, and that's why they call it smart, because you need a smart approach and smart home, and if staged to never have a huge peak, you can charge your EV during off-peak for ~$0.017 per kWh.

I spent 45 minutes on the phone with a lovely lady at Georgia Power and we were cracking up trying to mathematically calculate what the hell this power plan even means. So I'm not even sure this is correct.

If you don't have a huge and power sucking home, I think you could work this plan",2024-06-01 16:03:57

1d5k9l1,I made the mistake of talking EVs on a cruise,"My wife and I (40s and early 50s, respectively) are slightly below the median age for cruise ships.  Normally I'm garrulous and happy to talk to most people, but I feel I should know better when chatting with people from the core cruising demographic about EVs.  

Over the course of the last six days I had the following encounters:

- A fellow cruiser mentions them in passing that her car is 17 years old and she's looking for a new one, but would ""never consider an electric because of the range.  We're from Wisconsin.  It gets cold there. ""  

Me:  ""We're from Canada and have two. They lose range, but I still get around 180 miles on a charge from mine in January.""

Her:  ""But what if we want to do a road trip?""

I mean, okay.  But 180 miles is around 3 hours of driving and you just told me you were 76 years old.  Don't you take breaks?  

- Another one, unbidden one morning in the dining room:  ""I live in California but I'm  not one of THOSE Californians if you catch my meaning.  I'd prefer some place where gas isn't so expensive and the politicians were better.""

Me, an idiot, took the bait.  ""Oh okay.  I don't worry about gas prices.""

Him:  ""Why?""

Me:  ""I drive an electric and got a tax break on it.""

He harrumphed at this and muttered something about the batteries being bad for the environment.

I mean, he basically dog whistled that he didn't like the sort of politicians who put environmental safeguards in place then retreated to that hoary old chestnut about batteries being bad, ignoring the degradation fossil fuels cause in every step of the supply chain.

~~Also, since it's LFP the number of cycles may be anywhere from 1500-3000 before you notice a drop off (below 70% original capacity).~~ The Ultium platform is NMC at the moment (switching to LFP with the next gen Bolt).

Is anyone else considering using it for this purpose?

EDIT:  This battery pack uses NMC, not LFP, so that will reduce the number of cycles (but should still be about 1000 before 70%)

1d4w8mv,Blink charging network sucks,"EV owner for a little over a year now. I live near Washington, DC which has tons of Blink chargers. So sometimes I park in public garages that happen to have them. Horrible experience every time. 

1st time - charging was free for the first 4 hours, then a fee. I planned on staying less than 4 hours. Kept getting some generic error on each charger, tried three of them, same thing. Turns out, to use the free charging, you have to load $20 into your blink account. I assumed they would just charge my credit card on file if I got into the paid time frame, but alas no. The error message did not specify this at all. Overall got charging started after about 20 minutes, then had to call Blink on the way home to refund my $20 in the account.

2nd time - public charger in a public garage, charger serial number was not listed on the app anywhere, and I couldn't search for it. So I called the number to initiate a credit card charge session. It took my credit card and said everything was good to go. Then the system hung up on me. But the thing would not start charging. Did that twice. Fiddled with it for 20 minutes and then just left without plugging in. 

3rd time - same issue as the second time, charger serial was not listed in the app anywhere. Fiddled with it for about 20 minutes, then moved across the aisle and plugged into a different blink charger. It started charging without any authentication or credit card or anything. But it had a fancy LED screen while the first one did not. Glad to get a charge, but confused why it worked and the first one didn't. 

Just overall horrible. It should not be this difficult. They need tap to pay, or worst case NFC to your phone so the app actually works properly. I should not have to call a person to get a free charging session started.

It's just that we would *prefer* if we could throw some money at it to get more range since every other EV option on the market today feels like a step down (infotainment system upgrades, aside). 😅 Everything's either too big (even the Hyundai Kona got too large for our tiny driveway), too expensive, or too small (Fiat 500e, Mini), and we'd much prefer keeping this car running.",2024-05-31 09:28:13
1d4qr6f,Why does BYD sell PHEVs at a lower price?,"Considering the current lithium price, the cost for BYD to produce a 10kwh battery is about RMB 4,000. In this case, the difference in battery price between a BEV equipped with a 60kwh battery and a PHEV equipped with a 10kwh battery would be 20,000 RMB; the engine and gear system required for a PHEV would cost at least around 15,000 RMB. In this way, the cost for BYD to produce a BEV is likely to be almost the same as the cost to produce a PHEV.



However, BYD tends to sell BEVs at a much higher price than PHEVs, typically around 30,000 RMB difference in price.



Of course, BYD does not disclose the cost of each vehicle, so we can only speculate as to the reason for this.



Since BYD holds a sufficient share of the BEV market in China, there is little need to expand its market share by further price reductions. On the other hand, it is possible that BYD believes that it can take share from ICE manufacturers by lowering the price of PHEVs.",2024-05-31 08:30:53

I live in a new build condo with normal wall outlets in my garage so I plugged in the charger and started charging the car. In the app though it says the vehicle is plugged into a level 2 charger 240V??? How is this possible with a level 1 charger cable and a normal wall outlet?  Did I just get lucky and my condo is already equipped with level 2 charging? My electrical panel has a sticker that says 120-240V - 60 hz. Or is this an error from the car/app?,2024-05-31 03:10:10

UPDATE: not possible. You must pay the ransom to use the hardware. 

See the conversation between OP and CP staff:
> To be clear: unless the host activates the station with ChargePoint, and pays any associated account/service fees, they aren't able to utilize the equipment that ChargePoint previously sold to them?

> Yes without a cloud plan from the chargepoint for this model. To know more about this we recommend contacting the activation team.

——————

My office provides workplace charging alongside the EV fleet vehicles.  At first, they were using ChargePoint EV charging stations, with cloud services including notifications, queues, etc. All but one of these ChargePoint servers have been replaced overtime with”dumb” plug & go Clipper Creek units. 

The question is what to do with the remaining ChargePoint CT4000 series charger. It’s currently “not provisioned” according to the screen, and the few “grace” charging sessions have expired. As it’s just one of the dozen or so chargers at the building, replacing it or spending money to signup for a corporate account isn’t a priority. 

We’ve checked through the service menu, the manual, and ChargePoint’s website and their is no obvious way to set the charger to unlock the plug handles at all times, and just charge any vehicle that connects. Does anyone know if it’s possible to set one of these ChargePoint stations to operate without a connection to the cloud and signing up for a paid ChargePoint host account?",2024-05-30 13:32:31

As far as I know, one liter of gas can generate around 3kwh with a good generator. The BYD car has a 65-liter gas tank so let's assume the gas can be used to generate 200 kwh of electricity. That means this car runs 12km/kwh.

The most efficient EV on the roads (not in a lab environment) can run up to 8km/kwh, so the Chinese company has found a secret sauce to boost efficiency?

Also, it comes with rather small HV batteries (\~15kwh), which means the HV batteries are always being charged and discharged simultaneously. Isn't this super harmful t9 the batteries? Is this going to be a reliable car?

Just need someone to explain all this. Thanks.",2024-05-30 13:23:10

1d3r6gj,PSA: insurance may underestimate the value of your totaled vehicle,"So, a PSA: in the event that your vehicle is totaled, your insurance may underestimate its value by up to $4000. (You can probably guess why.) I hope that nobody needs this information, but it might help someone else in the same position as me.

*Background:* A F-150 driver decided that ""yield to oncoming traffic"" didn't apply to Prius Primes and smushed my car last week. I'm okay, but the car is very much not. Most of it is in a junkyard. The rest of it is splattered all over the road. 

Insurance, as expected, declared it a total loss today. I had State Farm's coverage; their standard practice to calculate its value by looking up similar listings (called ""comparables"") from nearby sellers on Autotrader and adding/subtracting based on trim level, mileage, and features. Pretty reasonable, and pretty fair given how many 2017 Prius Primes are out there.

*However*, many Autotrader listings have the $4000 used-EV tax credit baked in. They'll advertise a car for $16000, with a little footnote that says ""federal tax credit applied but you may or may not be eligible; actual retail price is $20000"". Maybe this is deceptive advertising, maybe it's not; I take no position on that. In my case, there's a local EV-focused used car dealership that does this with *all* of their listings, and many of the ""comparables"" were from that dealership.

But the insurance companies (or the folks they delegate the job of calculating value to) don't read the fine print, and use $16000 as the value of the comparable vehicle. This leads them to underestimate the value of the total loss and underpay on claims. In this case, I don't believe State Farm has any intent to underpay claims. I called my agent and he said ""huh, that's interesting -- write a letter to your adjuster with the evidence that those prices are $4k low and they'll probably fix it for you.""

I haven't heard back yet, but this information may help someone who's in the same unfortunate situation as mine.",2024-05-30 00:31:50

We have 2 EVs and had to drive both a lot this past weekend for my kid's soccer tournament (we took 2 cars because, coincidentally, my mother was visiting my aunt at the same time, so I left the tournament half-way to drive her around). We drove about 400 miles on both cars this weekend. Folks new to EV ownership and anti-EV zealots would say this is a nightmare scenario but it wound up being a blessing in disguise.

We have family that happen to live at a location convenient to the tournament, so we stayed with them for the weekend. The husband has always been a ""big SUV"" guy (Escalade, Hummer, G-Wagon, etc.) but his brother was the first in their family to get an EV (first Tesla MY, now EQE). Now he and his wife, along with his 70-yo parents, have all switched to EVs (Lyriq, and Hummer EV—natch!), and in the process got L2 chargers at home. We wound up charging both our EVs at their place. In their neighborhood (solid middle class but definitely not rich) several folks have EVs and L2 chargers. I spent no time at gas stations having to fill up either car; they ""refueled"" while we were hanging out with them or while we slept.

Having EVs actually *saved* time (and saved us the hassle of dealing with grimy gas pumps and randos at gas stations). It may not always work out this way but it's definitely going in this direction. Pretty soon you'll be able to L2 charge just about anywhere you're visiting and it'll be done while you sleep or while you'd otherwise be doing something else.",2024-05-29 17:00:51

1d2qjz9,Electric car rental trip report - northern spain,"Hey everyone, wanted to share my experience as an US citizen with an electric car in northern Spain. With all the reports on reddit advising against an EV in Spain I wanted to provide a write up of my experience.

My wife and I did an 8 day road trip from Bilbao, to Picos De Europa, Santander, Llanes, Gijon, Parque de Somiedo, Cudillero, Ribadeo, then finished the trip in Oviedo. Needless to say we did a tonne of driving. 

We didn't intend to rent an Electric car but upon pickup in Bilbao they were out of suitable cars other than a Volvo c40 Recarge (full disclosure they had plenty of cars but they only had manuals. I haven't driven a manual in nearly 15 years so I wasn't comfortable navigating Spain in a manual. I even attempted to prepare for this and was trying to find anyone in the US that had a manual so I could practice but I couldn't find one). I've been wanting to explore EVs (and have been considering buy one)  and the C40 had enough range for us plus plenty of technology so we decided to give it a whirl. The agent at National wasn't very sure of charging network but I've been loosly staying informed.

The positives: Didn't have any issues charging at gas stations (BP had a super fast, Zunder was the best, always near somewhere to hangout and never had problems. Even got a 350KWH charger once). It only took a little extra planning to ensure we were charged for our longest drive (Gijon > Lagos de Saliencia > Aviles [215KM]). The recharge has a self driving-light mode that can navigate turns and such which let me enjoy the scenery a bit more. It was also great having the feeling I'm not causing extra gasoline consumption at a country I'm visiting (we try to do public transit on international tourism but northern Spain public transit was near impossible for us, plus most of Spains electric grid is from renewables). We also paid $~60-70 in charging which I'm certain is cheaper than gas would have been. Not having a car idling while pulling off roads to admire vistas or in parking garages was also great.

The neutrals: To get maximum battery we didn't use any climate control (weather was perfect so we didn't need it), I drove slower than the speed limit to conserve battery which worked for us since we were there to enjoy scenery. We likely spent about an hour sitting in the car waiting for it to charge. The BP we charged had nothing nearby, and the 3rd Zunder we used was next to a super market we could have explored but it was closed that day - we didn't mind since it gave us time to rest, enjoy some gas station snacks, or plan our route

The negatives: We likely spent about 3 hours across our 8 day trip unsuccessfully trying to charge in parking garage/public parking locations. They all require an app to pay. EDP required spanish address or tax code to create an account, same for Wenea, and Endesa X. Our most stressful day was when we were in Aviles down to 15% battery and the only chargers were EDP. Thankfully there was one Iberdrola and we were able to finagle the app enough to let us pay and charge. After that we stuck to only chargers that had a CC terminal in pictures.

Final thoughts: Northern Spain has so many chargers that I would 100% rent an EV again. If the car rental companies can provide a RFC card that is compatible with all chargers then charge me back the bill (similar to tolls) there will not be any reason to rent a gasoline vehicle. Nearly every public parking lot has chargers, every parking garage has chargers. Having the car charge while we go do tourist stuff or sleep (if any of them worked for us) is 1000% amazing. However, I still don't think it's accessible enough for the average driver yet. If my parents were in this situation I don't think they'd be able to navigate all the challenges we had to overcome with the 8ish or so apps we also had to download. It's so close to being so easily accessible!

TLDR: lots of driving and had an acceptable time figuring our charging with an electric vehicle. Plenty of room for improvement for ease of paying for charging. If you're in this subreddit you can likely navigate charging network",2024-05-28 18:27:57

That part is fine, however, they also want me to pay an extra $3k in penalties and interest even though they are just telling me about this error now.

Do I have any grounds to appeal the penalties/interest? I'm fine paying the $7.5k as it was ultimately my error (or Turbotax's rather...) but it seems kind of silly I'm paying for 2+ years of interest when they are just informing me of this now. Thoughts?",2024-05-28 13:11:28

1d26kgy,Could EV's set new records for extreme SPL Bass competitions?,"Recently saw an article talking about EV's and car culture and it got me thinking about the future of extreme bass car audio.   


Up until recently, car audio amplifiers worked on 12v. To deliver huge amounts of power to subwoofers, these amplifiers had to internally step up the voltage. This is not an efficient process. Step up converters usually occupied about 3/4 the amplifier's volume and generated lots of heat which required a huge amount of airflow. You would also need a lot of supporting equipment, installing multiple alternators, huge banks of batteries and very thick gauge wires to run these amps. For these systems, 20kw amplifiers are a big deal and would start at $3000, not including all the supporting equipment which will need to be installed.   


With the development of EVs, high voltage transistors are becoming very cheap. Using these transistors, new amplifiers have been developed which can run directly on EV batteries up to 600v. Companies such as Taramps and Stetsom now make 200kw amplifiers for only $800, 10x the power at less than half the cost. Because they run directly on EV battery packs, they are much smaller, require less cooling, less thick wires and no supporting equipment. $800 for 200kw is unheard of.   


For extreme SPL builds, it is much cheaper to buy an EV than to install all the supporting equipment in an ICE vehicle. Plus EVs are much stiffer and have less parts to rattle around. So could EVs be the next big thing in car audio? Could it change bass culture altogether?",2024-05-28 00:24:10

https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1d0y9nj/how_long_does_it_take_a_company_to_transition_to/

After reading through the comments of these two posts it becomes clear why hydrogen is a very foolish path to take for passenger commuter style vehicles.

It also indicates that it takes between 2-3 to 4-6 years to transition an auto company to producing electric vehicles?

The Tesla Model Y is the best selling vehicle in the world but it has been historically Toyota Rav4 and Toyota Corolla which are still way up there amongst other Toyota models.

Now I agree that battery electric vehicles are the future.  I think everyone can see that.

However Toyota has a strong name brand and is still selling a lot of vehicles and doing very well as a company.

Can someone explain in detail apart from just feelings why it doesn't make sense for them to wait another few years and then transition once battery electric vehicle supply chain and production techniques and such are fully normalized?

I personally don't think the other automakers could wait on the transition as they need to be competitive for name recognition.

However a lot of posts I see here and elsewhere talk about people eagerly awaiting a good quality battery electric Rav4 or Corolla.  That kind of anticipation and name association doesn't seem to exist with Ford and or GM in the anticipatory battery electric reveal type way.

(This is an electric vehicle subreddit so I know people want the switch to happen as soon as possible.  I am just looking to understand in an actual factual sense why this is not a good strategy as some say.)",2024-05-28 00:16:31

However, something that’s got me thinking recently about the future of EVs is when disaster strikes. If a hurricane or tornado or some such event hits a community or city very hard, and wipes out that local area’s charging ability, what then? 

This assumes a few things: 

1. That most cars and emergency vehicles are EVs for the hypothetical.

2. That the community in question had reliable means of charging before hand. 

3. That in this hypothetical community there was once easy access to gas stations for ICE vehicles.

1d1zbir,"BEV owners in cold-winter climates w/o home-charging, what say you?","**EDIT**: Thanks to all who have answered so far. Because my original wording may have been unclear, I'll try to clarify my question: If I leave a BEV unplugged for several nights in a cold-winter climate (where average nighttime temperatures drop into the single digits F/negative teens Celsius, and lower than that on some nights), how much charge will the battery lose just sitting there, unplugged? I want to know if the car will still start several days later after sitting like that out in the cold. Anyone who's owned a BEV in similar circumstances (parking on the street in a cold winter, only charging every few days) who can share their experience would be much appreciated.

OP:

I sold my ICE years ago and haven't owned a car since then (I don't need one in the city I live in). I'm moving soon to an area in the northern tier of the U.S., where I'll need a car. Nighttime winter temperatures where I'm moving to average in the low single-digits Fahrenheit/negative teens Celsius, but frequently drop into negative territory (Fahrenheit) throughout the winter.

I'll be renting, likely somewhere without a garage, and I'm particularly curious to hear the experiences of those of you **who own a BEV in a cold-winter climate and don't have home-charging/park their car outside overnight**. Where I'm moving to has good charging infrastructure, including around my workplace, so I should be able to access a charger as needed. But on cold winter nights, will I need to find a public charger and leave the car plugged in overnight to ensure the car's 12V and big batteries don't die? Theoretically, how many days could the car go *not plugged in* before it dies? Are there specific BEV models known to be reliable in this regard?

I won't be commuting far distances often so I'm not worried about how the cold affects range, plus there's plenty of literature out there about that. I just want to know if owning a BEV in a cold-winter climate without home-charging will lead to frequent battery issues or a fully dead battery.

1d1tyl6,Any Definitive Information on Battery Repair Method by Manufacturer - Module or Pack Replacement Post-Warranty,"I know many will respond that there's nothing to worry about because the battery packs are covered for eight years, 100,000 miles minimum.  I understand the comfort that brings to new car buyers but was wondering what it's like for used BEV buyers a few years down the road.

Besides Tesla and Hyundai Canada ($45,000 battery replacement cost fiasco half a year ago) employing whole pack replacements, there doesn't seem to be definitive information as to how manufacturers in North America.

Even for BMW, some sources suggest module replacements while others suggest whole pack replacements.  A tech from BMW confirms they do battery module replacements, which I think is great. 

If the BEV is under warranty, I probably don't care what the manufacturer employs but post-warranty, it does make sense to go for module replacements (as the repair cost will be much lower), then balancing the modules, though not really sure if they will offer the long-term solution / piece of mind a new battery pack provides.   For HEVs, new OEM battery pack is the way to go.

Besides experiences from BEV owners, how do we find out what the official take is from the manufacturers?

I had opportunities to work closer to home but I loved my job and didn’t see a way out of this money pit… then I  found out about electric vehicles! I earn a modest income and wasn’t looking for anything fancy or with all the bells and whistles, I was looking at a Nissan leaf, and. BMW i3.. 

I settled on a 2015 Chevy spark EV for $5500 a few weeks ago and it’s been amazing, I’m not paying for electric because  my electric is included in my rent and I also am able to charge from work, my range is about 67 miles on battery but you know what that’s just enough for what I need the car to do.. get me too and  from work.  I have never had any range anxiety and it’s a such a relief to have extra money in my pocket and I’m sure I’ll see more savings over time.. my next EV will be a Chevy bolt with the range over 200 miles..

Each panel has a single Enphase inverter installed under the hatch. Unfortunately, the generated solar power is not yet used for the propulsion system, only for the standard electrical usage of the crew, heating, airconditioning, pumps and such, because the propulsion system works on a different frequency and voltage. However, the generated power during sunny days should be sufficient for going downstream the river or navigating a canal, as transport by water is the most energy efficient way of transport. We own a barge like this and diyed a 9kW system like this ourselves a few years ago (the company who makes this is very expensive and the only thing they do is installing, Enphase actually does all the support and communication with Victron). Three 8kVa Victron inverters make sure there is always three phase 400v available, they manage the charging of the batteries and synchronisation with the auxiliary engines/shore power in case we need that. Additionally the main engine is also equipped with a heavy dynamo. We went down from running a 400 kVa auxiliary engine 24/7 to less than 100 hours a year, saving up to 20,000 liters of diesel fuel each year. The savings of this ship is unknown to me, but when it would be used for propulsion I think savings up to 50,000 liters a year would be possible.

After that ""service"" I've seen a rapid decline in battery life. Took it back to the dealer at 103k and they quoted me $30k to replace battery and of course now it's out of warranty! It's now down to 10 miles on full charge. Besides looking for a lawyer, I'm thinking the high voltage battery management system just needs to be reset, can't imagine the battery actually died that quickly.

Do most people have an EV as a second vehicle and a gas vehicle for long trips? How many have an EV as their only vehicle, and what do you do when you have to travel round trip that's longer than your given range? 

For example, I have a family member who lives 120 mi away. The second half of that trip as far as I can tell has no superchargers. That means if I went to visit and stayed overnight and charged it on his house current, it would still be an anxious ride back. I would likely have to stop sometime during the second half at the return trip where I might find a supercharger and kill rather large amount of time charging it up again. It doesn't seem worth it. 

Seems to me a plug in hybrid might be the way to go.

1d1368m,"Proposed way of measuring the ""range"" or energy capacity of EVs.","I had this idea that, if we measured the amount a car could lift itself against the gravitational field of the Earth, we could have a good comparative measure of charge capacity and engine efficiency. 

I asked Chat GPT to do some calculations, here are the results: 

&#x200B;

 Considering the amount of energy stored in the battery pack of a long range Tesla Model 3, and the efficiency of its motors, how high could it climb, vertically, theoretically? 

&#x200B;

 

The Tesla Model 3 Long Range has a battery pack with a capacity of approximately 75 kWh (kilowatt-hours). To determine how high it could theoretically climb vertically, we need to consider the energy stored in the battery and the energy required to lift the car against gravity.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Convert Battery Capacity to Joules:**  


* 1 kWh is equivalent to 3.6 million joules (J).
* Therefore, 75 kWh is:75 kWh×3.6×106 J/kWh=270×106 J=270 MJ75kWh×3.6×106J/kWh=270×106J=270MJ

1. **Energy Required to Lift the Car:**  


* The energy required to lift an object vertically is given by the formula 𝐸=𝑚𝑔ℎ*E*=*mgh*, where:
   * 𝑚*m* is the mass of the object (in kg),
   * 𝑔*g* is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s²),
   * ℎ*h* is the height (in meters).

1. **Mass of the Tesla Model 3:**  


* The mass of the Tesla Model 3 Long Range is approximately 1,800 kg.

1. **Calculate the Height:**  


* Rearrange the formula to solve for height ℎ*h*:ℎ=𝐸𝑚𝑔*h*=*mgE*​
* Substituting the values:ℎ=270×106 J1,800 kg×9.81 m/s2*h*=1,800kg×9.81m/s2270×106J​ℎ≈270×10617,658 m*h*≈17,658270×106​mℎ≈15,293 m*h*≈15,293m

### Conclusion:

Theoretically, the Tesla Model 3 Long Range, with its 75 kWh battery fully charged and assuming 100% efficiency and no other energy losses, could climb vertically up to approximately 15,293 meters (about 15.3 kilometers).

### Considerations:

* **Efficiency of Motors:** In reality, the electric motors are not 100% efficient. They typically have efficiencies around 85-90%.
* **Other Losses:** There are additional energy losses due to friction, air resistance, and other factors.

Taking these into account, the actual achievable height would be lower than the theoretical maximum. For instance, with an overall system efficiency of 85%, the effective height would be:

ℎeffective=15,293 m×0.85≈13,000 m*h*effective​=15,293m×0.85≈13,000m

Therefore, realistically, the car could potentially climb to a height of around 13 kilometers, considering the typical efficiency and losses in the system.

Great! Now do the same for a Model Y long range. ChatGPT

The Tesla Model Y Long Range has a similar battery capacity to the Model 3 Long Range, typically around 75 kWh. The mass of the Model Y, however, is slightly higher due to its larger size and additional features. Let's proceed with the calculations:

### Step-by-Step Calculation for Tesla Model Y Long Range:

1. **Battery Capacity:**  


* Battery capacity is 75 kWh.
* Convert this to joules:75 kWh×3.6×106 J/kWh=270×106 J=270 MJ75kWh×3.6×106J/kWh=270×106J=270MJ

1. **Mass of the Tesla Model Y:**  


* The mass of the Tesla Model Y Long Range is approximately 2,000 kg.

1. **Energy Required to Lift the Car:**  


* Using the formula 𝐸=𝑚𝑔ℎ*E*=*mgh* and solving for height ℎ*h*:ℎ=𝐸𝑚𝑔*h*=*mgE*​
* Substituting the values:ℎ=270×106 J2,000 kg×9.81 m/s2*h*=2,000kg×9.81m/s2270×106J​ℎ≈270×10619,620 m*h*≈19,620270×106​mℎ≈13,760 m*h*≈13,760m

### Conclusion:

Theoretically, the Tesla Model Y Long Range, with its 75 kWh battery fully charged and assuming 100% efficiency and no other energy losses, could climb vertically up to approximately 13,760 meters (about 13.8 kilometers).

### Considerations:

* **Efficiency of Motors:** In reality, the electric motors are not 100% efficient, with typical efficiencies around 85-90%.
* **Other Losses:** There are additional energy losses due to friction, air resistance, and other factors.

Taking these into account, the actual achievable height would be lower than the theoretical maximum. For instance, with an overall system efficiency of 85%, the effective height would be:

ℎeffective=13,760 m×0.85≈11,700 m*h*effective​=13,760m×0.85≈11,700m

Therefore, realistically, the car could potentially climb to a height of around 11.7 kilometers, considering the typical efficiency and losses in the system.

What about a Cybertruck?ChatGPT

The Tesla Cybertruck is larger and heavier than both the Model 3 and Model Y, which affects the calculations for the vertical climb. The battery capacity for the long-range version of the Cybertruck is expected to be higher due to its size and weight, typically around 200 kWh. Let's proceed with the calculations:

### Step-by-Step Calculation for Tesla Cybertruck:

1. **Battery Capacity:**  


* Battery capacity is approximately 200 kWh.
* Convert this to joules:200 kWh×3.6×106 J/kWh=720×106 J=720 MJ200kWh×3.6×106J/kWh=720×106J=720MJ

1. **Mass of the Tesla Cybertruck:**  


* The mass of the Tesla Cybertruck is estimated to be around 3,000 kg.

1. **Energy Required to Lift the Car:**  


* Using the formula 𝐸=𝑚𝑔ℎ*E*=*mgh* and solving for height ℎ*h*:ℎ=𝐸𝑚𝑔*h*=*mgE*​
* Substituting the values:ℎ=720×106 J3,000 kg×9.81 m/s2*h*=3,000kg×9.81m/s2720×106J​ℎ≈720×10629,430 m*h*≈29,430720×106​mℎ≈24,451 m*h*≈24,451m

### Conclusion:

Theoretically, the Tesla Cybertruck, with its 200 kWh battery fully charged and assuming 100% efficiency and no other energy losses, could climb vertically up to approximately 24,451 meters (about 24.5 kilometers).

### Considerations:

* **Efficiency of Motors:** In reality, the electric motors are not 100% efficient, with typical efficiencies around 85-90%.
* **Other Losses:** There are additional energy losses due to friction, air resistance, and other factors.

Taking these into account, the actual achievable height would be lower than the theoretical maximum. For instance, with an overall system efficiency of 85%, the effective height would be:

ℎeffective=24,451 m×0.85≈20,800 m*h*effective​=24,451m×0.85≈20,800m

Therefore, realistically, the Cybertruck could potentially climb to a height of around 20.8 kilometers, considering the typical efficiency and losses in the system.

1d0a7nl,"Poland to Spain and back: 5,700 km with a Mercedes EQB","TLDR:  it was a trouble-free trip that cost about 40-50% less than doing the equivalent trip with a Mercedes GLB.  My wife and I loved doing the trip in the EQB and we had a great time overall.

My wife and I recently drove our Mercedes EQB from Krakow, Poland where we live to see some friends that live near Valencia, in Spain.  What follows are my notes and comments about the journey.

Our return trip through Poland, Germany, France, and Spain was a total of about 5700 km (3540 mi).  On days that we were going from one overnight stop to the next, we averaged around 90 km/h (55 MPH) driving, on average, about 600 km (375 mi).  I typically set the auto-adjusting cruise control to between 110-120 km/h (68-75 MPH), so driving through cities, roadworks, congestion, etc accounted for the average of 90 km/h.   Our daily average consumption was as low as 17.5 kWh/100 and as high as 19.6 kWh/100, but typically around 19.2 kWh/100.  Including some incidental driving around at various locations, we spent about 69 hours driving.

**Charging issues**:  we essentially encountered no issues while charging, though did find a few IONITY chargers that weren’t working.  In the case of the IONITY chargers, we simply moved to another charging station at the same location.  We also were able to charge at most of the hotels we stayed at, with one exception in Dresden where both of a hotel's chargers weren’t working.  In that case we went across the street to a public charger (SachsenEnergie) and added a bit.  We never encountered a situation where we didn’t get the max charging rates for our car when initially charging.

**Charging time and costs**:  not including the destination/hotel charging, we spent a total of 11.15 hours charging, and approximately 1725 PLN (390 EUR).  My back-of-the-envelope maths says that, in an equivalent GLB (Mercedes's petrol version of the EQB), the trip probably would have cost around 850 EUR in petrol.  We typically made three charging stops per day.  Because we weren’t in a huge rush, we would often go to the bathroom, get a sandwich and coffee, etc.   The EQB we have charges at a max rate of 100 kW, but has a fairly flat charging curve between 10-80%.  Most of the time the car would be charged up before we really finished with whatever it was we were doing.

**Charging locations**:  other than the aforementioned SachsenEnergie, we used IONITY, Fastned, Electra, and Tesla.  IONITY’s locations are mostly barebones, Fastned have the really nice covered stations with some places to sit but not much else, Electra has partially covered locations with good amenities (rubbish/recycling bins, squeegee, picnic tables or places to sit).  The Tesla locations we used were similar to IONITY’s, mostly barebones.

**Charging apps**:  We used Tesla's app to initiate/review charging at Tesla charging points.  The rest of the time we used the Mercedes Me Charge RFID card to initiate the charging at IONITY, Fastned, Electra, and SachsenEnergie  chargers we used.  We also used the Mercedes Me app to monitor charging progress.

1czsad4,AWD Blazer EV RS Test Drive ,"I was dropping a friend off at the Chevy dealership so I decided to test drive the Blazer EV. I'm more interested in the Equinox EV, but they didn't have one yet and I like to try everything out before I make a decision.

Impressions of the car:

Styling is subjective, but I like it okay. Not enough to impact my decision either way. It looked like it did in the pictures, seeing it in person made it seem no better or worse. 

The AWD RS had most of the bells and whistles that I'd like to have so it was a pretty good tester. I would want the fake leather seats and the sunroof, so I’d pay more for more features. It does seem like it should come with a sunroof.  The cooled seats and heads up display worked well. 

My first impression was that the 14” screen was massive. I had read the measurement and seen it in pictures, but in person it was different. There were no glitches on my test drive and it seemed responsive and I personally liked the redundancy of the climate controls below the screen. Temperature knobs are the way to go in my opinion and I also like the big toggle switches for things like the fan.  My little monkey self likes a tactile experience with the car. I’m okay with big screens, but I’d rather not have them do everything and there are some things I just don’t want to do by voice control.  I didn’t get an impression of high quality, but that’s really nothing specific, just a general impression. 

I didn’t connect my Google account, so I don’t know how well that system works. I tried to connect my phone with Carplay before remembering that it doesn’t exist on the Blazer. I used bluetooth which worked fine. The stereo seemed okay, but it’s hard to tell on a short drive. I did say “Hey Google”, and it popped right up and informed me I needed to connect my account. So it was responsive.  I controlled my phone just fine using voice comments through a long press on the steering wheel. I’ve been using Carplay since 2014 so that’s the known quantity for me. Not a deal breaker to go without, but definitely a negative check box. I’d like to have the choice. 

Driving was fine. I’m coming from a Rav4 Prime, so driving eclectic is my preferred mode, but it’s not new to me. So I didn’t get that first time in an electric car epiphany. The horsepower was fine, I was concerned as it’s a big heavy car. Pretty much larger than all the competition in the segment, and larger than any car I've owned.  I took it on the freeway and the passing power was acceptable. Not really what I want, but probably all that I really need. 

Some odd things about the Blazer: 

The back seat has a hard plastic piece about 2.5 inches high running between the back rest and the seat across the whole back seat, that makes the seats uncomfortable. You really feel it there on your lower back. I think it’s part of a system to make car seats easier to install, but I’m not sure. It’s bad enough to be a deal breaker to me. 

I felt like the steering wheel needed to go up just a little more. I could see the screen okay, but felt like it wasn’t optimal. Not a deal breaker, but a negative. I prefer a cockpit style instrument cluster but the flat screen style seems to be in right now. 

The rearview mirror is tiny, I mean head scratchingly small.  I’m 57 and I use reading glasses so I find the rearview mirror cameras to be a strain on my eyes. When I flipped it to be a regular mirror it seemed to be a bit darker than a normal mirror. I can see the advantage for many of the camera mirror, but I’d probably end up replacing it with a normal and larger mirror. I’m not sure if that would be an issue for many people. 

So it’s not the car for me, as I can spend more money and I want more than an okay EV, but for others it might be great. For the price it’s worth checking out, especially if you need an EV SUV that’s a little larger. It also has better basic controls than most vehicles. I predict cars will go back to more physical controls, but right now I think they are trying to look futuristic.",2024-05-24 18:54:36

The number of times I've been asked what happens when my battery runs out is also surprising. My typical response is to ask what happens when their car runs out or won't move. Ya get towed.

I'm currently exploring the capabilities of electric vehicles in terms of energy management, specifically focusing on Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) and Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) technologies. I have a couple of questions and would appreciate any insights you can offer:

1. **Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) via Wallbox**: Can I use a Wallbox to facilitate V2L to power devices at home, or is it exclusively for charging small devices like a laptop or plugining in a fridge while camping or such? If it's possible, what kind of setup or additional equipment would I need?
2. **Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) Usage**: Is V2H significantly faster or more efficient in providing energy to a home compared to V2L? What exactly differentiates V2H from V2L, aside from really bidirectional changing so I know it can be used as some kind of external battery for my house.

I’m trying to understand the practical applications of these technologies, especially if I can use my EV as a backup power source for my home using a Wallbox or other equipment. Any detailed explanations, personal experiences, or resources on how to set this up would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you!",2024-05-23 19:39:31
1cyz4bj,Buyer beware with Ford EV vehicles ,"I’ve had an ongoing issue with the fact I purchased a brand new MachE GT with a $2000 BlueCruise option that has never worked. 

I have other posts about this issue but what I want to let others know about is some observations I’ve had about Ford. 

Ford has had many problems with the MachE, including a major recall. The dealers in Metro Detroit, heart of FMCO country, are overwhelmed with repairs for the EV vehicles. There are 1 maybe 2 techs for an entire dealership. This means extremely amly long wait times to get an appointment and then your vehicle sitting at the dealer for another lengthy time, even for simple repairs/software updates. 

Ford’s response to me has been to blame me and try and deflect rather than any form of customer service acknowledging the issue and making sure it gets fixed. They also won’t return the money paid for BlueCruise subscription.  Keep in mind my $2000 was ONLY for the subscription and nothing else included. It’s like paying for any subscription ahead of time. 

I have been a long time purchaser of Ford vehicles and purposely didn’t look at other brands, particularly Tesla, because I was worried about support. 

Ford talks about EV’s and commitments but in reality none of that matters because their dealers aren’t on board. The dealers only concern about EV’a is that they believe that they will be out of a job and won’t make money anymore on service. I have that information from a high level person in the dealers association here in MI. 

My issue is minor and small overall but the reps at Ford have made the situation incredibly bad and at times worse. Think of what you want from your vehicle and what support you will if and when something goes wrong. A warranty is just a piece of paper until you have use it. Don’t be like me and get left twisting in the breeze and regretting putting faith in Ford.",2024-05-23 17:55:52

Right here goes, I'm looking at buying an EV (maybe kia Niro) , it's early days in my research but need help. 

I'm considering buying a used 3yr old car and looking at theoretically running it into the ground over many years e.g @ 13 years old vs changing after at say 6  years 

It's a simple question and I suppose all long term owners must know the answer. 

Question. A cell ages with use and it's capacity/efficiency reduces (e.g to 50% of it's original capacity), does it still take as long and also cost as much to charge NOW to reach this new degraded cel capacityl (now 50%) as it once took to reach 100% charge (when it was new)  

I understand it could take twice as many charges to cover the same distance, but is it twice as long in time and worryingly twice the cost effectively reducing output efficiency to 50% and costing twice as much to cover the same distance.

Years ago in this sub there was lots of discussion of the advantages of EVs. The early adopters knew they would get questions and looked forward to sharing their knowledge. I convinced two people I know to buy a BEV a few years ago, and have had positive conversations with dozens more who I think walked away more inclined to buy one. Some purchased PHEVs.

This sub now focuses mostly on model-specific news. It's almost brand advertising half the time. More and more EV purchasers just aren't aware of how much ignorance, misinformation and hostility is out there, and aren't prepared to even defend their purchase, let alone convey why others would want to do it. 

I wouldn't mention this, except we are getting new waves of political and industry pushback in various parts of the world.

I live in not the safest area, and I’m worried about purchasing an ev with that being one of the only charging options in walking distance from me… i’m not able to get a charger for my unit, and I could charger at work but would like both options, since the charger at work is a slow charger. I also have a longish commute (60 miles roundtrip) so I’m thinking through the range anxiety and logistics.

Do cars get stolen or broken into at chargers? Can people “steal” the charge? Sorry if these are stupid questions!",2024-05-22 20:24:10

I've tried looking at both Toyota and Volvo's websites, and I can't figure out what kind of plug either vehicle uses. I'm not certain if they should keep the Tesla charger and just get an adapter to use it with the new vehicle, or if they should remove the charger and just rewire for an outlet. 

If it's relevant, they are not keeping the Tesla because they are not comfortable taking it long distances and have not adapted well to the differences in operating and driving it.

1cxtuay,Cost of 240v home install? Feel like I am being over charged.,"Not an EV owner yet. But since most are leasing very well, I figured I would look into it.

Challenge is that I am a renter. It is a single family home with a garage.

I got permission from the property management company to get a 240v installed and had their contractor come out (it’s a well reviewed one).

Breaker panel is in the garage. The outlet is going to go right under the panel.

Quoted $1,000….

Understand that a GFCI breaker (required) can get pricey, and an industrial outlet depending on brand can also get up there. But the price just shocked me. I expected around $500 give or take a bit. But dang. Was my thinking that far off?

*Update*

REALLY Appreciate all the posts. When/if I do get an EV (going to look this weekend), this sub appears very active which is awesome!

Going through all (well most) of them it seems the consensus is that it sounds fair, a little steep, or I am getting hosed lol.

I did see a lot of posts reffering to permits. I don't see any reference to permiting on the estimate. Just the following:

-Install a new CH250GF breaker in the panel.
-Install a new box location directly below the panel.
-Install 8/3 copper wiring from the panel to the box below.
-Install polaris taps for wire terminations.
-Install a 14-50 receptacle and cover plate.
-Verify proper voltage and label circuit.

Eh I will probably just pay it. They are a very well reviewed company. And I have kiddos in my house, with my son sleeping on the first floor of the garage. While I am quite confident I could do it myself, 1k for a bit more peace of mind is worth it.

Also I did look into any type of incentives offered by the city or power company. And the only thing is that my power company will give me a free EVSE, I think a Chargepoint Home unit, but only the 14-50 version not the hardwire version. And it's mine to keep I just have to do their ""pilot"" program for 3 years. So I will at least get that out of it :)",2024-05-22 06:42:27

After getting the car transported there because I can't drive for such a long distance, when I got it back 24 hours later it was clear it was driven by the person who transported it. 

The range after charging however fell off from 63 miles to 32 miles (It was 74 when I purchased it in 2020). 

Anyway, I never got any of the range back after resetting trips A & B. But what's worse is that it keeps going down. After 6 months of moving into this new city, it's 29! 

Luckily, I live very close to work (2-3 miles), but this is rather scary. I have not driven this car anywhere really, and have not had it for a long period of time. The range just goes down almost with every usage. 

I have not had the battery replaced since purchasing, and the warranty wouldn't have covered it at that point because it was not deteriorating. 

But now, it is..

So, we had to get someone to come and pick us up in the middle of the night, so my daughter who had just graduated had to get in her Corolla drive 25 miles alone at 1am to pick us up go back home, get some sleep so the next morning we could go another 50 miles round trip to pick up the car. So, we drove 100 miles in a gas car so that my son could drive 165 miles in an electric car which ended being like 225 miles in an electric car to get a charge. Put a tent over that circus.

Say there is a Taycan in his collection, which he doesn't actually seem to drive. Is there something you can do to make it so the car, when garaged for years without bringing driven, will actually start up?

I know some kids toys or appliances, or electronic devices basically say, ""if you don't plan to use for a while, remove the battery"", but is there an equivalent suggestion for EVs?

I know people have posted about having an EV in a vacation home that they only visit a few times a years, etc. Is the guidance the same? Like the car isn't going to know if you didn't drive it for 3 months or 3 years, or 30 years, and is there really a difference?

I called again today to ask clarifying questions like ""do they replace my other garage spot"", ""do you share with other people or is it just for you"", etc. and they said it's a reserved spot, and actually, right now all the spots are taken so none are available.

Not sure if this would even work (don't know if the chargers are some how registered to specific vehicles, etc.) but figure it won't hurt to ask.

1cv2exj,A Tesla driver's first experience with non-Tesla fast charging.,"On a recent trip to SFBA, my Avis 'mystery car' turned out to be a Mustang Mach-E.

The car is very nice, but I want to discuss how my charging experience differed from my experience at home, where I drive a Tesla.

TLDR: It wasn't that great, but it could have been worse.

There were two main points that stuck out.

1. Fragmentation. I had to add EvGo, ElectrifyAmerica, and Blink apps to my phone, and give each my credit card data.  Previously, I'd managed with just Tesla and ChargePoint (for level 2).

It felt kind of like the proliferation of streaming TV services. Some kind of unified payment system would help a lot, so you didn't have to maintain separate relationships with each service. I don't have to use different credit cards for Shell and Texaco.

2. Low number of outlets per site. While the number of locations with CCS/SAE seemed comparable to Tesla, each site contained no more than 4 charging stations, and many only 2. I think the lowest I've seen for at a Supercharger is 6, and 8 is now pretty standard for small locations (some have far more). 

In 5 years of EV driving, the only time I've had to wait more than a minute or two for a supercharger was last month, when it seemed every EV in New England piled into northern Vermont for the eclipse. However, at CCS DCFCs, a wait was normal, and sometimes quite long.

FWIW, my worst experience was with EVGo, which consistently failed to start, and (to my surprise) Electrify America was the best. 

One further minor point: The CCS/SAE connector is a PITA compared to the Tesla connector, and the cable was extremely bulky and stiff. I could see some people having serious problems just getting it into the socket. The 250 kw cables on Superchargers are liquid cooled, and much slimmer and flexible.",2024-05-18 17:27:25

I had to call several times to get someone to actually initiate the return process and when they did get a replacement out to me, it wouldn't connect to the app so I could not control it, though I could still charge at home. 2 weeks go by with no communication other than ""be patient, we're waiting for our I.T. dept to come up with a solution.

This morning I got an email from someone at support asking if my issue had been resolved and if so they'd go ahead and close the ticket.  When I said no, it wasn't he actually took steps on his side to rectify two things on their end and I was able to get things working within the X-Way app, so now I have full control with my replacement Juicebox 40.

Hi - I am renting  a Kona for 3 months while my car is getting fixed. I consider myself tech savvy and smart but I have never driven a EV and have questions re charging stations 

Last Sunday I paid .50/kw and the total was over $60 to get me from about 10% to 75%. (55 kWh). This was @ a ChargePoint. It only took 50 mins, but wasn’t noted as a DC FAST. ChargePoint app says 12kw. This place had a break down between energy rate and station time rate. I realize there was a penalty for sitting at the spot longer than 15 mins, even though I was still charging. How did my car charge so fast , even tho it was 12kw? Plug was chademo/combo. I can’t remember what plug I used  . 

On Wednesday, at a different station, I was charged .02 cents a min, it was a 6.6 kW AC ChargePoint at my office. Super slow but I was working so no big deal. Total was $4.80 to take me from about 15%  to 35% or so. Total kWh was 25. 


Thursday night, I charged at a DC fast ChargePoint. My car was only charging at 27kw (I guess per hour), even though the charger said 50kw. I charged from about 10% to 90%, it took 2 hr 14mins, but it was only $.63! The rate had a “station time rate” and said .28 for first 0 min, but 3.00/hr there after.  How did I only pay 63 cents? If I go back here, how can I get it to charge faster? It has a chademo/combo. the plug I used had circle thing with wide oval below it.

The Tesla Model Y in America in 2023 was the 5th best selling vehicle (385,900 units sold, estimated).

4. Toyota RAV4 (434,943 units sold)
3. Ram Pickup (444,926 units sold)
2. Chevy Silverado (543,319 units sold)
1. Ford F-Series (750,789 units sold) *24,165 of these sales were of the electric F-150 Lightning pickup.*

Ford even was up 15% from the year before.

I personally would have loved Tesla to continue on the extremely affordable Tesla Model 2.  The unique affordable platform with the different construction method was interesting and I thought would have opened up electric vehicles to more demographics.  Maybe they thought it would cut into Tesla Model 3/Y sales?  Maybe the margins even with enhanced sales were not great?

Frankly even what they are talking about now with a simplified Tesla Model 3 as the new potential middle ground vehicle before doing the new platform/new construction method of the Tesla Model 2 seems more interesting to me than the Cybertruck but I am purely a simple commuter and affordability is key to me.  I realize that isn't the case for everyone and a business may have other interests.  I can understand them wanting some of that big truck market share.

So my question is what do you think the future will hold for the Cybertruck in competition with the Big ICE models?

Personally I think it is ugly as sin and some of the other issues make it not at all interesting to me past a novelty but again I am not even someone interested in that space so I am not really their demographic.

1ctoohq,6 Months and 2300 Miles With a Blazer EV,"[Following up on my previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1acwu9b/2_months_and_1000_miles_with_a_blazer_ev/).



tl;dr; I am still satisfied with my purchase and will consider another Blazer EV in the future. 



Mechanically, the Blazer EV is great. It drives nicely and handles well. Coming from a Chevy Volt, the turning radius is surprisingly similar for a vehicle about a foot longer and wider. It doesn't feel like driving a tank like other SUVs. 



The software, aside from bugs, is a mixed bag. The UI could use a redo. It feels like too much form over function. The use of space is questionable, and some of the touch buttons are small enough that they aren't easy to press in a moving vehicle. The screen is so large, but with so much empty space, it could have been smaller, and nothing would have been lost.



# Stop Sales, Software Updates, and Recall Updates

* The February update caused my wireless charger to stop working randomly, and the recall update didn't fix the issue. I have seen the same complaint in r/CadillacLyriq, so it must be some software bug with the platform. 
* The Recall Update took about two days to complete. It fixed several minor bugs, and Ambient Lighting is working now. 
* The downside of the Recall Update is it introduced a new software bug. The charging door no longer closes after 30 seconds. Even after disconnecting the charging cable, the green light on the dash still pulses.
* Chevy could have communicated more effectively about the stop sale. After the fact, it was a software issue, but I wasn't sure if it was a mechanical issue at the time.
* I still haven't received an OTA update (if one is even out). I am worried because dealer-installed updates seem complicated, and an OTA update may brick my vehicle in my garage.

# Software

* As far as I can tell, there have not been any significant updates to the software or new apps added to the market. 
* The entire package still feels like a downgrade from Android Auto as it will not display messages from Google Chat, Discord, or Messenger. 
* I don't know the roadmap or what features are coming, but the software is still the Blazer EV's weakest point.
* This is a hard sell for the software as a service subscription model.
* When using the cameras, I wish the screen would zoom in a bit more. The UI needs more space for such a large screen. 

# Rebate Check and New Pricing

* I received the rebate check for the new price difference within two weeks. Chevy deserves credit for a goodwill outreach. 
* The new prices make a lot more sense and distance the Blazer EV from the Lyriq enough. It also better aligns with other mid price EVs.
* I am still slightly salty about missing out on the Ultium Promise rebate because I purchased the Blazer EV in December. I had no way of knowing that deal was coming. 

# Interior

* The piano black panels are just the worst. Around the cup holders, I have a few faint scratches despite being careful with microfiber cloth wipe-downs. I would pay extra money not to have these in a future vehicle.

# Accessories

* Basic accessories, like a console organizer or cargo cover, are still missing. Third-party vendors like BestEvMod have them available, but I'm not really sure what Chevy is doing.
* There is an official Tesla charger adapter coming from GM. It seems like Chevy should have gotten on the ball after Ford did theirs.

# New Options

* The dealer order site added Super Cruise in March, but it isn't an option on the customer's website. That package also includes the Enhanced Parking Assist, which I am disappointed that the parking assist wasn't included in the RS trim. 
* The Ambient Lighting is just for the tabs on the air vents. I wish there were more substantial lighting options like my Volt had.

# Things I would like to see in a future Blazer EV

* There should be more interior color options. All black is boring, and the red is a bit much for me. Maybe a dual-tone grey/black.
* There should be more options, such as stereo upgrades, Super Cruise, sunroof, etc. I am sure that will be resolved in the 2025 models.
* The RS trim with 102kwh battery on all motor configurations. The 85kwh should be for the LT trim.
* The RS motors performance upgrade. For a ""Rally Sport"" it is a little slow for an EV.
* Eliminate piano black or glossy surfaces on parts that are touched often. 
* Camera upgrades. The dead zone in front of the car still feels janky. The front camera position makes it hard to park even with guidelines. While parking on an incline/decline, the 360-degree cameras get visual distortions. 
* I would like more position adjustments on the steering wheel. I am slightly tall, and the wheel obscures part of the instrument panel for me.",2024-05-16 21:38:00

I've recently entered the EV world and have already felt like it'd be nice if there were more charging options at places where I find myself on a daily basis. We're in a small town which has \~5 total charging stations of any type so there aren't many options in town to charge and the EA price of 0.56/kw is more than I want to pay for anything other than road trips.

I'd like to get a couple EV charging spots in my parking lots for EV charging both to provide a benefit to my customers but also to attract new customers who are EV drivers. Are there companies who install for free in order to get more of their network built out?

# Dr. Billy Wu: How Charging Routines affect Degradation | Battery Podcast

**My question is whether Mr. Wu correct in that SOH isn't always a good predictor of remaining battery life?**  From this subreddit, I always read about people posting SOH without regard to the reserve/buffer capacity.

Around the 25 minute mark:

 batteries which are at 90% state of health.  One battery because of how it's being used could uh degrade significantly or reach what we call its knee point in another 100 Cycles whereas the other one might have uh 500 Cycles before it's degraded so therefore those two batteries at 90% of state of health ...

Key take-aways for me:

* State of health (driving range/original range) is not a good predictor of remaining life
* Keeping SOC lower helps with battery longevity.
* Fast charging is never a good thing, though convenient for obvious reasons.
* There's more sensors required aside from voltage, current and temperature to fully assess the state of the battery cells.",2024-05-16 15:51:57

**Question**: are there any chargers out there that can ""auto-detect"" for other chargers on the same circuit and initiate a ""load sharing"" handshake.  If not or if these are not reliable, are there chargers where we can manually set an ""EV CHARGER ID#"" so a smart charger can recognize the other chargers on the circuit for load sharing?

I have never felt something that runs so smooth and we are saving about 170 dollars a month from what we used to spend on gas. While not the greatest range for longer trips (we have ABRP for that) it is really doing wonders for our very small daily commutes. Love the technology package and the customization I can of the menus. My old vehicle was a small 2010 Hyudai ICE sedan so while for some people this is standard...this is quite the upgrade for me... as my 14 old car just had a cd player haha.

What impressed me with these new leafs... leaves...???... is how sharp the lines are. The old bubbly ones are cute and have their charm but I love how this one looks.

I am also impressed with the EV community as everyone no matter what they drive has been super friendly and helpful. I am sure there are elitists or those who scoff at my very basic package Leaf but again everyone has been awesome.

I am wondering if their is any EV etiquette or unwritten rules I should know about as an EV driver...

I always try to check in on plug share if it is a non network charging station to save people a trip or give and estimate on how long I'm going to be there. I also try to give people  enough room if there are multiple chargers so they can get in and out and plug in their cars. Today a guy had his huge Ford plug in parked outside the lines diagonally in the stall.... really makes me wanna be careful and considerate of others.

I am also little nervous as somewhat aggressive massive lifted trucks are everywhere and anti ev sentiment is a little common in my area. Does anyone ever get harassed or cut off or get coal rolled on them. Has anyone tried to mess with your car while charging. Or are those incidents far and few between....

Any tips or tricks are also appreciated.

1csspu4,[MIT Technology Review] How did China come to dominate the world of electric cars?,"TL;DR

1) Early 2000’s the Chinese government recognized that they would never be competitive with ICE and Hybrid tech since others already have a huge lead. They took a big risk and made a bet on the nascent EV technology. They also recognized that the tech would solve some of their pressing issues with pollution. 

2) In 2007, Wan Gang, a former automotive engineer for Audi in Germany, became the Minister for Science and Technology. He was a supporter of EVs and push the country down the EV path. 

3) From 2009 to 2022, the Chinese government provided $29 billion in subsidies and tax breaks to EV manufacturers. 

4) The government jump started EV adoption by pushing for conversion of public transportation, taxis, buses and trains, to electric. Other things like rationing licenses helped push EV adoption with consumers. 

5) Consumer subsidies were opened to ALL, including foreign firms like Tesla.  (I find this fascinating)

6) Chinese companies and ,I assume, supported by the government, pushed battery tech especially the development of LFP batteries. 

Not sure how to feel about this. Seems like the Chinese companies with support from the government took a big bet on EV tech and built out an entire system around it. This strike me as rather entrepreneurial on the part of the Chinese companies and government. The effort was almost two decades in the making. I am pretty sure this cannot be replicated anywhere else.

The other thing that astonish me is how relative fast and efficient all of this is, if the numbers are true. The Chinese government invested, in terms of manufacturing support, $29 billion across 13 years. This is outside the consumer subsidies that every government worldwide did, and now they have a huge lead in EV and Green tech, in general. There is a possibility several world-class companies will be coming out of this.",2024-05-15 18:57:12

The dealer mostly repeated the content of the recent [press release](https://media.vw.com/en-us/releases/1797), although he didn't think the Euro-style flip-up trailer hitch would actually make it here, which I think is right.   

Three trims will be available initially, with 1st Editions  coming...first...and then the other trims following shortly after. 1st  Editions, they say, will likely have every option ticked by default,  with the exception of:   

&#x200B;

1. Drivetrain selection, single motor (RWD), or dual motor (AWD, 4Motion) , in addition to     
 
2. Two-tone exterior color selection (Orange, Green, Blue, Yellow, and Silver I think).     
 

Previously, it was believed that only RWD would be available at  launch, but it appears this is no longer the case. I did ask about heat  pump availability but there's no official word on this yet.   

As for timing, I was told that my reservation (1st in line at my  dealer as I made my reservation in 2018!) will likely be built in  Germany in the ""38th week of 2024"" (Sept. 16-22) and then shipped over  here, hopefully sometime before the end of 2024.

1cscrou,Ioniq 5 vs XC60 road trip,"A friend and I decided to do a road trip test with our two vehicles - Ioniq 5 and XC60. Technically the XC60 is a PHEV, but for road trip purposes it's pretty much 100% petrol.

We left on Friday afternoon at 1pm. It's a 450km trip to our destination. The XC60 driver did a straight shot with a 12 min petrol and snack stop, arriving just after 6pm. A typical road trip where getting to the destination quickly was the main goal I guess.

The Ioniq 5 had a slightly different time. They took a total of 3 charge stops. They had planned two stops at superchargers but the first was out of order, and they didnt have enough juice to make the second without a pit stop so had to grab a bit of charge at two separate spots at 50kW before they reached a 350kW charger. They eventually arrived at 8:30pm, having grabbed a decent dinner and enough charge on the way to get to and from the ski fields for the next couple of days. The driver was fairly frustrated by the broken charger and unplanned stops, but the family still had fun, had plenty of time to stretch their legs at places they wouldn't normally visit, and they had the better dinner. We called it a tie, both families were happy and rested that evening.

We left on the return trip on 5:30pm on Sunday evening. Both families stopped for a leisurely dinner about an hour into the trip, and hung around eating and chatting while the EV party recharged there. It was a cold evening and the charge was much slower than expected. We probably would have preferred to eat in the restaurant rather than back at the charger (which was slightly out of town) but we had a good time hanging out. We eventually left at 7:20pm, and everyone was keen to get home. The XC60 stopped briefly to refill and arrived back home at 11:40pm. It was a pretty slow trip with some traffic but not too bad, and they were happy to get back to bed.

The Ioniq 5 stopped twice more, including a 40 minute charging stop at 10pm at another 350kW charger. We made it home at 12:25pm, not too much later than the ICE as we missed most of the traffic. This one we called a narrow win for the petrol car, the kids didn't cherish the lengthy break on a cold night in a deserted country town.

Honestly the experience in the Volvo was less stressful overall. But it was a close thing. We agreed that a few more charge points on the way would be nice. We did look a little enviously at the Teslas plugged in to their supercharger stations which we couldn't use! And we couldn't fully replicate the ""get there as fast as possible"" trip in the EV, the time taken to recharge means we need to enjoy the journey a little rather than obsessing about the destination. But we both agreed this was not a bad thing.

After every year finishes I check the actual numbers when it comes to Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV), Conventional Hybrids, Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), etc. etc.

Guess what...

They are always up lol

Yes interest rates are high right now.

Yes although the economy is doing good there is a general feeling amongst regular folks and families that there is still a massive Affordability of life crisis and so they may be holding back from big purchases.

Yes some people are holding back till standards like NACS, apartment/work charging sites, and so forth come into place.

All that being said Electric Vehicles are going to keep increasing and increasing in market share.  The GROWTH has slowed down.  There is still growth..  Year after year.

Now for the future:

1.  Rivian R2, R3, R3X (In particular Rivian R3)

2.  Chevrolet Bolt EV on the Ultium platform

3.  Volvo EX30

(Rumored Hyundai IONIQ 2, Here and there Tesla Model 2 that is either its own platform and unboxed model and or a simplified Tesla Model 3 or Model Y (No one really knows lol), Rumored Ford Compact Crossover, etc.)

https://www.caranddriver.com/news/g29994375/future-electric-cars-trucks/

These and others are going to lead to a lot more sales and growth going forward.

The technology, engineering, and software are going to keep improving and improving just like they always do.

We will keep seeing a better charging infrastructure in both quality and vastness.

We will keep seeing batteries improve in quality/life/range/weight.

We will continue to see prices improve with scalability.

1crut27,"Dealer trying to charge more because ""EV""","Ran into an interesting situation yesterday and wanted to see if anyone else is running into this.

My EV6 went in for it's 24 month service (tire rotation) and I picked it up yesterday.  It also had a recall they took care of.  Went to the dealer in Schaumburg, IL, which I've gone to before and have been happy with.

Note, this is not a knock on the service department, they do good work and really seem to know the car.

Basically, they have a new policy for EVs, where they are basically charging more for service, simply because ""EVs are different"".  The service advisor was honest and says he doesn't agree with it, but management is making them do it.  For example, they wanted to charge $60 for a tire rotation, vs $35 for a gas car.  I called bullshit and got them to drop the price.

One one hand I get it, maintenance and service is a big revenue stream for a dealership, and EVs are cutting into that.

On the other hand, do they think we're idiots?

EDIT:  I think some people are missing the point here.  Yes, I know I can do my own rotations.  Yes, I know they can be done cheaper or free elsewhere.  I was wanting to start a discussion to see if this was an isolated incident, or if this is a worrisome trend or charging more simply because ""EV"".  It isn't just tire rotations they are trying to charge more for, they had a whole list of ""EV maintenance items"" that was separate from the ""ICE maintenance items"".",2024-05-14 15:22:45

1crf1r0,My thoughts on how Elon is running Tesla,"Seeing all the Supercharger drama compelled me to make this post:

The year is 2009. Tesla is running short on money. The company has delivered its first 200 roadsters to buyers far later than anticipated. All delivered roadsters are recalled for safety issues. Just a few months before, Elon had laid off 20% of the company, presumably to cut costs. Elon had to wire his last 3 million dollars to the company with no guarantee of return because the company would otherwise not have been able to make payroll. To a lot of people, this was proof that the arrogant dot com millionaire would soon realise that he was ill equipped to run a hardware company.

In March 2009, Tesla engineer Peng Zhou leaks information relating to the company's finances to the press. When Elon found out, he fired Zhou and made him apologize to the company. Elon would then send documents to the rest of the employees compelling them to inform him if they had ever leaked information to the press with the promise that they would not receive consequences. Elon wanted to run a company in which important information was not being kept from any employees, but constant leaks would be a betrayal of that trust. To a lot of outside observers, Elon was an egomaniac obsessed with secrecy, whose witch hunt would create a negative atmosphere in the company that discouraged productivity, and Tesla would have been better off with a more stable and rational CEO. He was being ""known more for feuds and firings"" than building cars.

In the same month, Tesla unveiled a hurriedly built Model S prototype. Hurried, because Tesla was on death watch. Tesla had a significant backlog on roadster orders. The company was bleeding money. So to a lot of analysts, Tesla would never be able to deliver on an even more technologically challenging vehicle. The Model S was described as ""absolute vapourware"" - the type that was common in the software industry that Elon was coming from, but Tesla and Elon had the ""gall"" to take deposits on this imaginary vehicle. And even if they succeeded, Tesla would also never lead the EV revolution because they made toys for rich people. Fisker was a better candidate.

One more anecdote from another Elon company: In 2018, Elon was not happy with the progress being made by the Starlink team. 3 years after announcement, the starlink satellites that had been developed were too complicated and too expensive. Instead of reassessing with his team like a ""stable"" and ""rational"" CEO would have, Elon jumped straight to step 2 of his ""algorithm"" and deleted the executives outright. He and a group of trusted engineer would take on the former executives roles and do it themselves.

So, how did those decisions work out for Elon and his companies?

1. Tesla delivered on all the roadster orders, unlike what experts and armchair executives thought
2. Tesla did not go bankrupt, unlike what experts and armchair executives thought
3. The leaks stopped, and productivity did not decrease due to the negativity, unlike what experts and armchair executives thought
4. The Model S was released and delivered, and became the foundation the electric vehicle revolution was built on, unlike what experts and armchair executives thought. Fisker is preparing for bankruptcy.
5. The executives fired by Elon moved on to Bezos' project Kuiper, where they are yet to launch anything significant. Meanwhile, Starlink is a mega constellation, has 2 million users, and made $6bn in revenue.

A more ""stable"" CEO would never have been able to take an automotive startup and make it the most valuable car company in the world, with over 1T in market cap at ATH. With a more stable CEO, electric vehicles would have been dead on delivery and Tesla would never have become synonymous with electric vehicles to the average person like they are today. I don't pay attention to any of the drama that happens day to day, like what's currently happening with the Supercharger team lately because that is how Elon has always run his companies, and I know that the drama is simply a part of the process.",2024-05-14 00:30:10

I would love to be able to either import one into to the US or try to buy one if I ever moved to a country in which they're being sold.

One thing I'm curious about, though, is reliability. A lot of Chinese EVs incorporate an absolute metric shit ton of electronics and unnecessary moving parts that add a lot of new potential points of failure to the car. Additionally, Chinese manufacturers do not have the same amount of experience building cars like brands like Toyota and Honda do, so I'd assume that would also affect potential reliability 

Predictably, though, as an American, it's fairly hard to find information regarding the reliability of these cars. I know I've seen people say that BYD cars are pretty reliable and can be driven well into 6 figure mileage without much issue, but I've found next to no information regarding the reliability of other Chinese car brands.

Despite that, there are a lot fast chargers built in the city center and by fast I mean 300kW. However, I am not using them because

* while driving in a city I can park and charge, so AC charging is just part of parking: 0 overhead (and sometimes the fringe benefit of having a parking spot available)
* AC is easier on a battery and AFAIK slower charging prolongs battery life
* more expensive
* when driving long distance prefer to charge on the road when battery level drops below 20% - charging is faster then

# Is an EV right for me? 

Generally speaking, electric vehicles imply a larger upfront cost than a traditional vehicle, but will pay off over time as your consumables cost (electricity instead of fuel) can be anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 the cost. Calculators are available to help you estimate cost — here are some we recommend:

My guess is that when it degrades it only takes 90kwh of energy for a ""full"" charge. Would this also mean a ""full"" charge is faster? Am I wrong? And if I am right does anyone have a link to info about that.

Battery% used \* battery in Kw = Kw used

Kw used \* cost/Kwh = cost per charging session 

So in my 2017 Kia Soul that has a 27kw battery, if I charge from 30%-80% with electricity cost of 9c/kwh:

.50 \* 27kw \* .09c = $1.20 

One consideration though is the Soul has a 27kw battery, but since it has certainly degraded some over time how do I find out what the actual size of it is now?

1cqc3g7,2024 large PHEV analysis: large PHEVs expanding but still limited,"Yesterday, Car & Driver released a new article ""[Are Plug-In Hybrids Finally Making Good on the Promise of the Best of Both Worlds?](https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a60731731/plug-in-hybrid-explainer/)"" discussing plug-in hybrid technology & every model available in the US market. There are many rounds-ups like this. Most PHEVs are small with mid-sized options growing a lot recently. Few round-ups focus on large vehicles, so here's a quick analysis of the current state of 3row PHEVs, focused mostly on the US market:

I believe the 2016 Volvo XC90 T8 plug-in hybrid was the very first 3-row PHEV available anywhere in the world. For many years it was the only one, and it & the Tesla Model X were the only 3row electric vehicles with plugs, globally.

Here we are \~8 years on & there are manyfold more choices for small & mid-sized EVs & PHEVs than the mid-2010s, and also now some more choices for large full EVs (eg Rivian joining Tesla's party). I couldn't find a round-up focused on 3row PHEVs so I decided to quickly analyze the breadth of offerings myself. Here's the report.

Things are going in the right direction, but only slowly for those who need to haul 6+ people & especially 7+, and especially for those who want/need AWD too, or good electric-only range, or a price tag that has fewer than 6 figures before the decimal point.

For many years since the original plug-in XC90 came out there were many models on the market that had available 3rd rows or available plug-in hybrid trims but the 2 things were incompatible (in most cases because the batteries took up space that was needed for a 3rd row). The Rav4 & Mitsubishi Outlander were 2 notable examples of this, and it's still an issue today for a few models (eg GLE, Range Rover).

* Volvo XC90 is still going without a major redesign in all this time, but with a refresh that expanded electric range to \~33mi vs the original \~14. (Electric-only ranges vary by a few mi here & there depending on source, eg XC90 currently quoted as 32-35 depending on site, but I'm gonna drop the \~ meaning approximately below here. All numbers come from some reputable source & should be close.)
* Minivan-sized Mazda CX-90 seats up to 8 but only goes 26mi electric-only.
* Minivan-sized Lexus TX 550h+ has e-range of 33mi but seats only 6 as mid-row is only available as captain's chairs on the plug-in, whereas other non-plug-in TX models can seat 7.
* Chrysler Pacifica is the only actual PHEV minivan, with 32mi e-range. It's available with as a PHEV or with AWD but those can't be had together currently, unlike all the AWD PHEV SUVs that make up the bulk of the rest of this list.
* Toyota Sienna minivan is a hybrid, but not the plug-in sort despite Toyota adding plug-in versions to so many other models in its hybrid lineup. Like many other things, this seems like it's only a matter of time, but probably not before the next major redesign.
* The recently announced refresh of the Audi Q7 (& Q8) seat 7 & can do 53mi all-electric with newly expanded battery packs, but don't seem to have any announced plans to come to the USA.
* Mercedes GLE has a 450e PHEV version that does 48mi all-electric, or has an optional 3rd row, but they can't be had together.
* BMX X5 has a plug-in version but the model dropped its 3rd row entirely in the last redesign.
* Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe PHEV has only 2 rows.
* Porche Cayenne E-Hybrid PHEV has only 2 rows.
* Range Rover Sport P550e PHEV has only 2 rows.
* Range Rover (non-sport) has a PHEV version (P550e) or an optional 3rd row, but they can't be had together. Notably, this is quite expensive compared to the others on this list.
* Toyota Grand Highlander is the platform the Lexus TX is based on, but like the Sienna is not available as a plug-in version.

Note, most of the above SUVs unless noted as being minivan-sized are ""mid-sized"" with lengths around 195"" (with the exceptions being Audi Q7 & Range Rover being a few inches longer, so between that size and typical minivan size). Thus, it's interesting that some have 3rd rows & some don't.

This is clearly more options for large PHEVs than existed in the middle of the last decade, but it's also clear that the number of choices for hauling a lot of carge or especially people, which is a huge number if powering only with gas, is much more limited if powering with a combination of electric & gas. That ratio is much greater for the large end of the market than for the 5 or fewer passenger end.

It will be interesting to see how much the PHEV market expands  before being mostly replaced by full EVs, especially how the next 4-8 years (about 1-2 full redesign cycles for many brands) unfolds.",2024-05-12 16:44:35
1cqbp37,Re:re:re Manual shifter for EVs ? ,"I’m putting ( re re re) in my title because I know there was already many discussions about this before and the general consensus was : EVs don’t need a gearbox, it’s just a gimmick and if you want a shifter just drive a real manual car. 

But now that we’ve all seen those reviews of the Ioniq 5N and all the praises it got, isn’t the next step an OPTION for a clutch by wire and a shifter by wire ? 

I think that that car already have all the software to enable that : the fake gears, the fake hard rev limiter, the fake clutch kick and the fake sound so IMO it’s perfectly doable.  

At the end of the day you will still have your one pedal drive with adaptative cruise control and lane change assist etc…

I really can not imagine that other manufacturers won’t make their version of fake gears with all the praise the Ioniq 5N got so this technology will be improved !

We all know some ""purists"" will still call it fake and gimmicky but I really don’t care if it is because this OPTION is better than nothing and it’s just needs to be fun ! And it can be on your every day car ! 

And also I’m still waiting for some reviews of the Koenigsegg cc850 with its manual/auto gearbox which can also bring back shifters for ICE or hybrid cars. 

So for me it seems like the ""fun"" and ""affordable"" manual won’t die ! And i’m adding fun because almost all new manual ICE cars right now feels like afterthoughts or just cheap option except for some sport models (mx5, gr86… and some really expensive Porsches).

What’s your take on this ? 

Edit : for people against this : are you against the OPTION for the shifter or you are against all the he ioniq 5N gimmicks ? 

Edit 2 : wow I think some people really didn’t understand that this OPTION can be disabled and you have a normal EV with a third ""none functioning"" pedal. 

I really don’t understand why you are against an (once again) OPTION that can bring more people to EV 

Edit 3 : Thanks for all your answers and takes guys ! 

Last edit : - seems like reddit only read titles (who could have guessed ?)

- this option would only add a shifter by wire like in sim racing and a third pedal. Nothing mechanical beneath , AND ONCE AGAIN THE CAR ALREADY HAVE ALL THE SOFTWARE TO IMPLEMENT IT.",2024-05-12 16:26:36
1cqbg6f,How important is an enclosure for an outdoor charger installation?,"I’ve got a 48amp outdoor rated charger with a 60amp breaker on my outdoor panel ready to go. It will be mounted and directly wired within 2’-3’ of the panel.

Does it matter if it’s in a box if mounted against the house and under the drip line? I had one electrician do a quote and insisted it have an enclosure no matter where it was installed, others did not even mention it.

  
Edit: Thank you all for the support. I’m ready to get this thing on the wall and working. It doesn’t sound like it would be an immediate need. In the future I may have a nicer enclosure built around it to match the house. But it doesn’t sounds like a huge priority right off the bat.",2024-05-12 16:15:33
1cqa8hn,94% battery range after 10 years,"It’s been awhile since I charged my car to 100%, but I knew I had a long trip planned for today so I charged my 2014 Tesla Model S to 100% and original range of 246 miles is now 232 (94%). 

Granted, I only have 90,000 miles on the car, which is low for 10 years, but that’s still 10 years of age and 3-4 charge cycles per week. 

In case some are wondering about region/climate, I live in the Atlanta suburbs and the car has been in Georgia, Florida, and the Carolinas over its lifespan. 

Another disclaimer is that I won’t get quite 232 miles in real-world driving conditions (running the AC, using the navi, playing music, etc) but that was true when the car was new. Also, not sure about other EV brands or models, but AC or heat does’t seem to affect my range much, nor does music streaming or using the headlights, but I notice that I consume the available range faster whenever I use the navigation system. In fact, if I have the navi running for the entire drive, it seems to reduce my range by 8-9%.",2024-05-12 15:20:40

1cptm7f,Great charging experiences at new Ford dealership chargers,"I haven't seen much mention online or news coverage of the new high-power DCFC stations that have recently been installed at a number of Ford dealerships in the last few months. Unlike many other such chargers at dealerships that have often been marked only for customer or staff use, some of the Ford locations have been very clearly marked as being open to the public, and are accessible either by credit card or one of the charging network apps.

In these photos are the stations at Washington Ford, Washington, Pennsylvania, and at Mathews Ford, Sandusky, Ohio. They're both right up front adjacent to the front street. In Sandusky, they've taken the front part of a used car lot, that was already brightly lit overnight, and put in pads and electric service for four charging stations, two of which are now active. At Washington, the two stations are right next to the entrance to the dealership, you can't miss them, and they're also well lit. Both locations include security cameras trained on the stations, and have high power, 180 or 250 kW chargers shared across two ports.

As for the EV, it's a 2023 Hyundai Kona Electric, which we've had for more than a year and over 17,000 miles. While it's slower to charge than plenty of other EV's now, maxing out at 77 kW at below 60% SOC, it perfectly suits our needs: it has plenty of range, is fun and comfortable to drive, its user interfaces make sense and aren't completely touchscreen-dependent, and it carries plenty of stuff. We downsized from a large Infiniti SUV but the transition was worth it. The only significant modification was the addition of a trailer hitch for the sole purpose of carrying a bike rack for two Lectric electric bikes, or a cargo pod for the few occasions when we can't fit everything we want to carry, inside.

Most of our travel is local, with a periodic 420 mile trip between Maryland and Ohio. This regular road trip has become much easier in the time we've owned this EV with the addition of new charging stations along I-70 and I-68 in the past year, including the one pictured at Washington.

1. \*\*Intense Workload and Toxic Culture\*\*: Employees describe a work environment that is extremely stressful, with high expectations and poor management practices contributing to a toxic culture. One mid-level manager detailed an experience of working in 'panic mode' with excessive hours and a lack of collegial support, leading to a petty and bureaucratic atmosphere.
2. \*\*Safety and Quality Concerns\*\*: There are significant concerns regarding the handling of assembly errors and software issues, which reportedly compromise the safety and quality of the vehicles. These issues are attributed to a combination of inadequate training, poor management, and aggressive cost-cutting measures that overlook proper procedures and safety standards.
3. \*\*Mismanagement and Unprofessional Behavior\*\*: Serious allegations have been made about unprofessional behavior among the leadership. Speculations suggest that promotions within the company have often been based on personal connections or sacrifices rather than merit, and include accounts of favoritism and inappropriate conduct.
4. \*\*Impact on Employee Well-being\*\*: The corporate culture is described as punitive, with employees under constant pressure to meet unattainable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This fear-driven approach leads to high job dissatisfaction and turnover, adversely affecting employee well-being.



[The top executives enjoy privileged lifestyle in closed door.](https://preview.redd.it/60mq3fbezqzc1.jpg?width=630&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68fdc739460f21203994ecf8c57e28650bc1960c)

From an ethical consumerism perspective, these reports raise significant moral questions about supporting companies that engage in such practices. Consumer complicity through financial support can inadvertently perpetuate these harmful corporate behaviors. Ethical consumerism advocates for making informed purchasing decisions that consider the social and environmental impacts of a company's operations. This approach emphasizes the need for transparency, accountability, and a commitment to the well-being of workers.

Choosing not to support corporations that exploit their workers or engage in unethical practices is more than a consumer choice; it's a moral stance. By prioritizing ethical considerations in purchasing decisions, consumers can influence corporate behaviors, promote fair labor practices, and support the movement towards more sustainable and responsible business practices. This not only helps improve working conditions but also fosters a more equitable and just corporate environment globally.",2024-05-11 07:17:05

1cp9n96,How close do you get to stated range?,"My wife is looking for a new car and has been looking at plug in hybrids due to some tax concessions available in australia. However options are limited and we have a unique requirement to try to keep the total width of the car under 1870mm due to narrow driveway (it is a must to get it into the garage for charging).

We’re now looking at full blown EV options which there are more options available now. However range anxiety is huge. She drives to the city every couple of weeks, it is a 340km round trip.

Would it do more (or different) damage to an EV versus a modern ICE car?  Would that actually be moot because of the infrastructure issues (both gas pumps and chargers offline)? 

Would there be anything to do as a preventative measure to protect an EV such as disconnect the battery, lower the state of charge, or put it inside a parking structure?",2024-05-11 01:41:42
1cp3clu,First EV Road Trip in Progress,"Picked up a 2023 Mercedes Benz EQE SUV 350+ in February with all the lease deals going wild, and have been loving it so far. My wife and I both fully work remote so the longest distance the car regularly travels to is the Whole Foods 4 miles away.

I live in the suburbs of Los Angeles and my wife is from the greater Sacramento area, and so a couple of times a year we do trips up north, anywhere between 350 - 450 miles one way. This weekend is one of such trips, as we're doing Mothers' Day with her mom in Sacramento. We left the house at 99% charge, and once we got out of the LA metro area it was open roads all the way up until we hit traffic near Sacramento.

Pulled into Kettleman City with 34% SoC (~190 miles in) to lunch and charge at the big 10-stall EA charging station (the same one that was backed up Thanksgiving weekend). Wife had to take a work call while we ate, so we stayed for just about an hour, which got the car back into the mid-90% SoC. Pulled into my mother-in-law's driveway with 16% SoC 225 miles later.

I'm not a hypermiler or any kind of eco-minded driver whatsoever. I'm usually the asshole telling the guy in the left lane doing 80 to get out of my way. Car crushed miles like a champ, averaged 3 miles per kilowatt hour while I caned it above the speed limit most of the way with the A/C at 65 degrees and fan speeds set between 3-4 and my ventilated seats on. My Eco star rating was 1 out of 5.

Two weeks before I got the EQE, we had done a trip to Santa Rosa (~450 miles) in our previous vehicle (2021 BMW X1 sDrive28) without needing to refuel, and my biggest concern about going EV was that our trips up north would become somewhat of a hassle or a logistical hurdle. As many users here have reported from trips of their own, it's actually pretty easy. Electrify America seems to be working pretty hard in the larger metros of California as far as I can tell to continue upgrading their high-traffic charging locations with the 350kW stalls and I had no problems charging up here in Sacramento at a historically poorly rated location (according to Plugshare). Although it's workable now, I do hope the infrastructure continues to improve so it's even less of an issue and to give drivers more flexibility as EV adoption continues to grow.",2024-05-10 23:23:21

1cox4ne,Question about EV batteries and raw materials,"Good Afternoon All!

I'm currently working on an assignment for school focused around EVs, specifically RIVIAN where I have to identify an opportunity to benefit the company in some meaningful way.  I want to propose that RIVIAN should invest in some program to make it clearer to the average person that isn't fully sold on the EV idea, because they think that all EV battery manufacturing is bad for the environment.  

  
Something that jumped out to me while researching was in another Reddit post from two years ago.

""EV batteries are not consumables like gasoline."" - I do know that batteries are recyclable, but this brings me to my question.  If this is true, then why do EV batteries ""wear out"", or degrade over time?  And if you recycle that battery and remanufacture it back into a new battery, what was the element that was needed to make it back into a brand new, usable battery?  I'm trying to understand what was consumed or lost throughout the batteries' life time.

1cowhgt,Any success stories of getting EV charger exemptions from apartment complexes? (USA),"I would like to purchase an EV for my next car but have ran into a potential issue, my lease does not allow for EV chargers via extension cords due to it being a tripping hazard. I was planning on trickle charging my EV via a high quality extension cord as my 2nd level apartment has a window facing the parking lot. It is a small complex about 5-6 townhouses wide. Has anyone had any luck getting an exemption from a similar policy? The agent for the management company I have been in touch with was sympathetic to my cause but wouldn't reply about possibly getting an exemption.

1copodp,New US and Canadian CCS chargers in April 2024,"**Here are all (\*) of the new US and Canadian CCS (Level 3 fast-charging) stations that rolled out in April 2024,** according to the Department of Energy. You can [get the data yourself here](https://afdc.energy.gov/data_download).

These chargers are suitable for most new EVs on the market, except for:

1. Tesla drivers who haven't bought the official CCS adapter yet. Certain older Teslas need additional work done to accept the adapter.
2. Leaf owners like me, owners of the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, and some owners of older cars that also use CHAdeMO. If you drive such a car, see my matching post in [r/leaf](https://www.reddit.com/r/leaf/).

**Some of these chargepoints will be ""refreshes,""** e.g. the provider replaced them with faster chargers etc. Some may be incorrect. This report is only as good as the Alternative Fuels Data Center data.

**There were 330 CCS charging stations with a total of 682 chargepoints added or refreshed in April 2024**, which is a major uptick in both stations and chargepoints. There were only 166 new CCS charging stations in April 2023, with only 267 chargepoints. Things are trending dramatically upwards.

Some part of this is due to Tesla Magic Dock stations. Previously Tesla didn't report these to the AFDC as CCS, but now they do. And that makes sense because all CCS drivers can use them.

**NOTE:** most Tesla Superchargers do NOT have magic dock as of this writing (all those shown in this report should have it). I recommend using PlugShare to locate compatible stations for your vehicle.

**(\*) ""What about other Tesla Superchargers? Can't everybody charge with NACS now?""**

It's coming for many makes and models, and for newer Ford models as well as a few other manufacturers charging at v3 and v4 Superchargers is already an option with a free adapter from the automakers. GM should release their adapter in the coming weeks. But since they are not open to *all* CCS vehicles, this report is not the place for them. Tesla's app provides the best guide to their locations, including locations that work with non-Tesla vehicles.

**Other Notes**

To streamline this post, multi-chargepoint locations are listed with the number of chargepoints first.

For serious trip planning, I recommend PlugShare. But by all means check out these reported new locations and submit reviews on PlugShare, which makes things better for everyone.

If you'd like to know about new chargers along your routes right away, or just prefer not to check this list monthly when new openings are rare in your area, I've set up a free service that provides email notifications as soon as they open. You can [sign up at evpov.com](https://evpov.com/). Or not! I don't really have a business plan here, I built it to help EV owners like myself. PlugShare has a similar feature.

1coos58,"Will we see a lot of well-appointed and well-equipped $50,000 USD BEVs in 2026?  Why 2026 if not to align with EU and North American emissions mandate / ZEV sales targets?","The world has fallen in love with CUVs/SUVs and I can't blame it, especially when it comes to BEVs where driving range could be only 15-25% worse than a comparable sedan or hatchback BEV.  Not every household needs 100% of the driving range of the latter anyway.

Maybe BEV sedans/hatchbacks/coupes will be priced $5,000-10,000 lower?

Lucid and Rivian are known to be using advance technology/features such as tri or quad-motors or at least knows how to implement torque vectoring functionality which helps improve stability and traction on dry, wet, muddy, icy, snowy, sandy road surfaces.

Are there any other manufacturers brave enough to announce more reasonably-priced CUV BEVs that are not too small in size to make it less practical for many households?



Lucid Will Build a New Sub-$50,000 Electric SUV Starting in 2026

During Lucid's first-quarter earnings call, CEO Peter Rawlinson confirmed a new high-volume, mid-size model is coming.

There have been a number of parties successfully overlanding in EVs using solar power. Most notable is the couple that drove from the Netherlands to south Africa.

https://preview.redd.it/fjezczegpgzc1.png?width=843&format=png&auto=webp&s=73188fb67bd71d1c6328bdb8dc2979552c73bdef

A number of people are charging their Teslas using large solar panel arrays they lay on the ground. A sample: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdexi5azaNE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdexi5azaNE)

A piece that seems to be missing in all of these is a mobile charger you could directly attach to a string of solar panels and then plug into your car. Most hacks do the Solar Panel->MPPT charger->48V battery->240VAC inverter->Mobile charge cord route which has lots of inefficiencies and require a lot of room and mass. It seems entirely doable to create a DC-DC converter that can handle the MPPT function and directly convert the power to the 400VDC needed to charge the car. Some small amount of local storage will be needed to handle sudden changes in solar power from clouds and other shadowing events.

My question is how large of a demand would there be for such a device? Are there others that dream of grid independence, far from home, and understand the inconveniences that would go with it? If we can get 100-200 interested people, we could do a kickstarter like project to spread the development costs, but I doubt it would ever be a viable consumer product.",2024-05-09 18:29:08

1co3c9l,New owner charger question,"Quick question for everyone….  Getting my first EV tomorrow, and debating my charge options (car doesn’t come with its own L1, which would have been my first plan).

Considering just installing a legit L2 in my garage (50A circuit is already in place), but have a question about connectors and charge standards.  My understanding is that the Tesla connector is or will soon be the US standard, is that correct?  And that is different than the J1772 that the Niro I’m getting ready to lease uses?

I am just wondering if it makes sense to install a Grizzl-e or similar for my Niro and have it be basically obsolete after my 24 month lease is up.  Or will it still be fine and usable for future cars also, even with the new standards?

My other choice for now is a cheaper, portable, L1/mild2 unit, just to get me through these two years.

Any help or feedback is appreciated.  I know with rapid tech evolvement, nothing is a hundred percent future proof; I just don’t want to install something that’s literally obsolete the day I plug it in.",2024-05-09 17:51:58
1co33os,Are self-driving cars all going to be EVs?,"I recently had a discussion with a colleague who was excited about the possibility and potential of self-driving cars, but who was also simultaneously opposed to EVs and who told me ""no one was going to pry his gasoline car out of his hands and force him to go electric.

I did something of a quick survey in my mind at it seems to me that all the leading companies building self-driving cars from Waymo and Cruise to Tesla are all doing so on EV platforms.  Which makes sense when you think about it.  Because if you are going to operate a car ""by wire"" it makes more sense for it to be electric in the first place.

So it seems to me that self-driving cars or autonomous vehicles should really be seen as EVs version 3.0 or 4.0.  And not some separate category of vehicles that are independent of the method of propulsion.

Do you all agree with this assessment?   Will self-driving vehicles just be a subset of EVs or future evolution of EVs?  Or are they something separate and are we going to see fully autonomous self-driving technology commonly rolled out on gas powered cars as well?",2024-05-09 17:41:50

1co0cc7,How I would make the BMW i4 a perfect car,"So to give you some context, my car history goes something along the lines of... a selection of Ford Fiesta's in my late teens and early 20's, a Mercedes C Class Coupe, my first foray into EV's with a VW ID.3, and now onto a BMW i4 which I've had a few weeks. I spend quite a lot of my life driving, so I get to know the inside of my cars pretty quickly.

With what I've seen so far, the BMW is clearly a significant step up from my previous EV (and on the deals I've had, good or bad, not a great deal more money than the ID.3 either). I absolutely love the car, and won't be changing it any time soon, but really just in case someone from the BMW EV department happens to frequent these pages, and just to vent I suppose, I thought I'd put a little list together of the 25 things I would change. Please do let me know what you think (they're all really minor anyway!):

1. Give me somewhere to put my right foot when on cruise control. With the accelerator in the absolute corner of the footwell, I either have to raise my leg and put my foot flat on the floor, or tuck my foot behind the brake (not a good idea!)

2. Maybe it's just my exact seat position, but the trim around the wing mirror reflects the road markings far too well, so in the daytime I have a constant flashing in the corner of my eye as each lane marking goes past

3. No grab handles over the doors. They're out the way, can't be expensive. Just... why?

4. Nowhere to put your sunglasses. Bit of a wish-list item, but with such tiny door pockets, and the central arm rest section not easy to get to whilst driving, an overhead compartment near the rear view mirror would be lovely.

5. All BMW's that I've been in really... the inside door handles are too close to the hinges. Imagine trying to open your kitchen door but the handle is 2 inches from the hinges. It's a) more difficult to open, and b) MUCH more difficult to get fine control over where it stops, especially important when cars are parked close by

6. When the wipers are in ""Auto"" there is no way of commanding just 1 wipe. Sometimes Auto is not perfect, and I don't expect it to be, I just want 1 more wipe of the blades without a full on windscreen wash. A quick pull back or tap for 1 wipe would be perfect.

7. Why are the AC and DC ports individually covered inside the charging port cover? It feels like just another thing for me to break when I try to close the main cover in the dark with the AC cover still open

8. Minor request to change the laws of physics here, but is there really no way of compensating for the polarisation of the HUD? I.e. could it be projected in more than one orientation so it doesn't go completely dark when wearing polarised sunglasses?

9. The indicators on BMW's are really fast (yes, jokes aside, I do use them!). Not an issue in itself, but it means than 3 clicks you get from tapping the stalk are over really quickly... too quickly for a lane change. Maybe 4 clicks or a slower tempo?

10. Maybe I need to go away and read the manual again, but how does one switch the wing mirror heat on and off? I'm assuming it works with the rear windscreen heat? Just a button on the screen would be great to be able to switch it independently

11. It's a saloon, so I know that means you don't get a rear wiper. But from years of driving I still don't understand that logic, it really needs one.

12. No indication of steering wheel heat being on or off, other than for a few seconds on the screen when you press the button. Just a little icon somewhere as a reminder?

13. Radio station scrolling via the steering wheel. I don't stick to one station. Why should it be so difficult to get from Virgin Radio back round to Absolute Radio? Just make the list scroll back round to the top when you get to the bottom, please.

14. Why are notifications only on either the main screen OR the HUD, why not both?

15. I get that it's not going to steer for me the whole time, nor should it. But the number of times I make a steering wheel input and I get the chime as it tells me it's not going to steer. Perhaps make the notification a little less invasive if there's actively an input on the wheel?

16. Another wishlist, but something the Mercedes did. It would be great to have an indication of what speed the car in front is doing. Coming up behind a car at night and trying to work out if it's going 69mph (not worth going past for now) or 65mph (probably worth it) would be great, without having to get so much closer or wait for my car to slow down to see what speed we settle at. Or maybe I'm just a terrible driver?

17. The door compartments again. Now they've got my sunglasses in especially, they're too small for even a small umbrella. British problems.

18. The void area under the bonnet where the engine used to be. It's an i4, we all know, I'll say no more.

19. The auto dimmed area on the wing and rear view mirrors for driving at night. Firstly, why doesn't it go all the way to the edge? Second, why isn't the passenger side mirror dimmed as well?

20. The boot release button on the driver door. Why do you push down to raise the boot, and pull up to lower it? It's the opposite way round to the window controls just a few inches away.

21. Putting shopping in the (massive!) boot, it's always going to fall over. Why doesn't it have loops on the sides like every other car (including other BMW's) to hook the bag onto?

22. When using the ""home"" screen with map taking up most of it, it would be great to be able to change the order and display of the side widgets. There's two I want to display, but they're not next to each other in the menu order so I can only have one or the other.

23. Auto Hold (P). I think BMW may be a relatively late comer to this function, seeing other peoples BMW's around without it. It's very violent on the i4. It will jam the brakes on when not quite stationary, and release them only when it's about to fire you at the back wall of your garage at 30mph. I do turn it off by default every time I put it in reverse, but I shouldn't have to.

24. HUD and Screen dimming on the one control. No. Should be separate, especially for night driving.

25. ""RTTI"" - Traffic information icon. When I press it, I really don't care about the temporary traffic lights on the road running parallel to me. Tell me about the traffic on my programmed route first!

  
Talk about first world problems, eh?",2024-05-09 15:43:19
1cnz4x2,Level 2 NEMA charging,"Hi,

I'm looking to lease either an EQE or a Q8 etron. I am in a rental house so I figure I will be doing the NEMA dryer plug charging hack instead of messing with the breaker panel. I have seen online that this works with Tesla's (and that it can charge much faster than the standard wall outlet).

My questions are:
1) Will this same trick work for the EQE or Q8 etron?  

2) If so, is there a limit the car will accept from this charging method?

3) Will something like this work for both vehicles? https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07THBGGMG?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=sofferscom888-20

My hope is that I will be able to do a full charge overnight (~8 hrs) using this method.

Thanks

1cn9epp,Run cost analysis,"I just did some back-of-a-napkin math and I wanted to present my analysis for a healthy (and kind) discussion here.  **Background:** We have two SUVs. One electric, one gasoline. Each car drives 300 miles a month. I’m ignoring many very long work and pleasure trips. Just doing day to day analysis with simple numbers as a sample.   Both cars are 2021 models, top trims, and both cars were $50K out the door (CPO), so I am glad that I am able to do an apples to apples comparison here (for the most part) as I haven't paid more out the door for EV to negate the gas savings on day 1. Both cars are at around 25k mile odometer, so fairly young for their age.  **Calculations:** Our gasoline car goes about 25 miles/gallon. Our electric car goes about 2.3 miles/kWh, conservatively taking the year round weather and harsh winters into account. Our per kWh charge at home is 12 cents. DCFC in public is about 36 cents per kWh if not more!  Now, to travel 300 miles a month (10 miles a day), we need 12 gallons of gasoline and at $4.5 a gallon, the total monthly fuel cost is about $55 per month. We do about $240 worth of total oil changes in a year so let's add $20 to the monthly running cost, so we are now at ***$75 to go 300 miles in a gasoline car with 25 mpg efficiency, in other words, about 25 cents per mile***! I am going to ignore service cost here because that would heavily skew this calculation and tip it toward electric cars.  Now, to go 300 miles a month in my EV when exclusively charging at home, we need about 130 kWh. So at 12 cents per kWh we need about $16 dollars rounded up. $0 in oil changes so we are now at ***$16 to go 300 miles in an electric car with 2.3 miles/kWh efficiency when charged at home (not a direct comparison with a gas car as we don't have gas at home on tap), in other words, about 6 cents a mile, and $48 to go 300 miles in an electric car when charged in public (direct comparison with a gasoline car), in other words about 18 cents a mile!***  Of course, these calculations use heavy rounding up and generalizations. Your electricity cost and efficiency of your cars may vary.  **Summary:** When priced equally, electric cars can save \~36% when charged in public, and \~78% when charged at home over a comparable gasoline car starting day 1. Gas certainly adds a little more convenience on very long road trips but their servicing can be expensive if things start to break compared to an EV but to counter that, these days gas cars come with very generous warranties. An EV may also have drastic service costs if something major happens to the batteries, but 8 years of warranty is plenty to counter that expense possibility. There is always the resale value factor, but I am going to conveniently ignore that and assume that we are keeping our cars for 8-10 years.   Do what you want with this information!! :)",2024-05-08 16:52:24

1cn65lf,Designing airport EV charging infrastructure,"There is this ""small regional airport taskforce"" that is trying to improve airport amenities.  Among those, they plan to install a bunch of Level 2 chargers. To my knowledge there is not a single EV owner in the group and the airport is faced with a big infrastructure bill to install the EV chargers that are needed.  -First, do you think airports should have Level 2 or Level 1 chargers? I think they should have a few Level 3 for rentals and a bunch of Level 1 for the general public, since most of the cars are going to be in the parking lot for 2+ days (I frankly would be happy with just 120V outlets where I can plug the Level 1 charger that the car came with).  -Second, can you suggest any materials that I can point the airport managers to? Costs of Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3? Airport usage rates?  Times that it takes to charge the car? etc?  -Third, general materials, such as best practices of charger implementations? Other things it may be helpful to them?     Thank you in advance for your help. I think I we have a real opportunity to make that infrastructure better!",2024-05-08 14:38:44

I plan on buying an EV sometime this year, but part of me fears that my battery will be obsolete or second-rate within the next few years. Are these advances in technology that are always ""just around the corner"" just marketing hype? Or does it make sense to lease an EV now and then buy one after my lease has expired and the miracle batteries have arrived?",2024-05-08 14:15:22

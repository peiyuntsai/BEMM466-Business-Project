1e59bpk,Best available EV under 50K,"I'm in the southwest USA and looking to purchase on a budget of ~50K. Here are my priorities, in rough order:

1. Safety
2. Autopilot / highway autosteer (city self-driving would be a nice extra, but unnecessary)
3. Handling / suspension
4. Range
5. Ease of use / features

I'll be mostly using the car for short daily tasks, but will occasionally want to do longer trips of ~500 miles. I work from home, so my daily driving is low--maybe 100 miles/week. I'm renting a condo so will not be installing any additional charging. I do have a golden retriever that I would like to transport as well.

I've driven a Tesla Model 3 and enjoyed it, so a Model 3/Y seems like a solid choice, but I've also heard good things about other cars on the market like the Mustang Mach-E, Ioniq, Chevy Bolt, VW ID.4, and more. While some of these might not be ideal over long distances, Tesla says they will open up their NACS Superchargers to other brands by Q1 2025 which might help.

Help me choose. Thank you!",2024-07-17 04:31:05

1e480tu,"Audi Q4 E-tron batterycapacity, Mileage and power usage dont add up?","Hello,

I'm just trying to make sense of these numbers:

Let us look at the E-tron:

https://preview.redd.it/3mytisiw9rcd1.png?width=1492&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0ca2acccde94a9130f5f776ec9b76a3a7aa2250

It says it will use 16,5-19,2 kWh to drive 100km.

And that it has a battery of 77 kWh.

Now, if we divided the battery capacity with the lowest value in the usage range, we should get 5,38, because they say it can drive up to 538km on a single charge.

But 77/16,5 = 4,67

In other words, if the battery capacity and usage range are right, the car will go between 401 and 466,67km.

This Is interesting to me because when you calculate taxes for cars imported to my country, you only type in Wh/KM and range. From that, it calculates the battery capacity using these two numbers, which makes sense in my head.

The battery capacity it calculates is just never the same as listed.

In this example, if I type in 165Wh/km and 538km range, it will calculate the battery capacity to be 88,77kWh, not 77 as listed. (165\*538/1000)

What am I doing wrong?

What don't I know?

I find the same with every car I've looked at so far.",2024-07-15 22:19:00

1e2gikg,Question about charging,"I'm thinking of getting a Polestar 2, but had a general question about charging since I've never owned an EV before.

I've been told that charging them on a high voltage charger like a Tesla Charger or Electrify America is bad for the battery, and that it's better to charge ""low and slow"" like on the 240 volt home charger or even the 120 volt wall socket charger. But I was also told that batteries have a limited number of charge/discharge cycles and doing it too much can hurt the battery too.

As it is right now, my plan is to charge on a 120 volt charger. I do about 30 miles a day, so a full battery would do a weeks worth of driving and I think if I get home, hook up the charger immediately until the next day, and then over the weekend just leave it on the charger most of the time then I shouldn't ever need a supercharger for it.

1e05g45,"Best electric SUV 2024. Range, interior design and efficiency","Hi ElectricCars!

I'm looking for advice. So far, my electric SUV research has taken up a lot of time, and the more time passes, the more questions I have.   
  
Let's start with a few exclusions:  
- after test-driving most, I am not a huge fan of Kia and Hyunday's EVs. They are OK cars, but they lack that premium feel, and I am looking for   
a) something a bit bigger that can fit a family of 4 with two dogs  
b) high-grade interior finish   
c) driving dynamics that are precise and exciting

My best list so far: 

**Genesis GV70**: I love the design, and it's 3.7-second 0- 60 time. However, I am worried about the range. Do you have any experience with this?  
**Audi SQ6 e-Tron**: it's a great car, but for Audi, I had a feeling that the interior of SQ6 is somehow not as nice as gas-powered Audis  
**Polestar 3:** I haven't tested-driven it yet as I have had many problems with my Volvo in the past. Are there any users of Polestar 3 here?   
**Tesla Model X:** I loved it. Its range is great, and the charging infrastructure is amazing, too. However, it's the most expensive one here, and my friends who bought Teslas often complain about sloppy finishing (I saw both nicely fitted Teslas and ones that were scary to look at) servicing the car, even under warranty. 

Nice haves: 

- Autopilot or a really good adaptive cruise control  
- An option to leave the dogs inside with AC on (I'm in Austin, TX)  
- Large (f)trunk  
- Good charging infrastructure

Must haves: 

- Reliable  
- Good service centers 

I'd love to hear your opinion if you own or drive any of these cars or if you have an alternative that you think is worth test driving. 

Thanks!",2024-07-10 20:04:37

Listen, I know one of these is not like the other, but I am considering all of them as my next car. I currently have a Model YLR and am looking to upgrade. 

Truthfully, the stalkless driving of the MS pisses me off. Can I get used to it? Of course I can but thats not the point, its stupid! But I do love the car besides that, having test driven it. 

The R1T I have always loved. I know people call it ugly but I love that uggo. I‚Äôm not a truck guy, but I don‚Äôt care I love this thing. 

The Lucid Air I admittingly know the least about, but I see their air credit incentives and they look too good to be true.

1dzd8ht,Electric Cars are Viable during Natural Disasters (and should have V2L standard),"Here is my point:

My electric car is 100% a game changer for me and my family in a natural disaster. 
My local community was just hit hard by Hurricane Beryl and was much worse than I thought it was going to be. My EV (‚Äò23 Ioniq 5) has the ability to V2L (vehicle to load), meaning I can power appliances from the car. 
I have been running my fridge, extra freezer, and multiple fans for over 24 hours since we lost power and used less than 10% of my cars battery in the process. We will likely be able to last a total of 4-6 days without power at this rate (sadly I didn‚Äôt charge to 100% before the storm)

I remember seeing many remarks about how some people were hoping that EV owners would get hit hard by the hurricane and come to realize how bad it would be to have an EV during a natural disaster. However we have been the one‚Äôs helping out more BECAUSE of our EV!

We do not need to worry about carbon-monoxide building up, filling a generator throughout the night, the noise of a generator, or the overall maintenance.

I gave all the gas I had to a neighbor who ran out and couldn‚Äôt find any at the gas stations because gas stations in the area are either out of gas or don‚Äôt have power to pump any gas. Getting gas is a big issue right now for many but when you don‚Äôt depend on it, it isn‚Äôt an issue.

While searching specifically for cars that have nice sleeping setups when the seats are folded down, I completely overlooked the Tesla M3 because of the coup√© design. But it turns out that not only can the seats of the M3 fold down, it even has a ""camping mode"" that circulates air while you sleep so inside doesn't condensate. For this reason I'm starting to feel like the M3 is our only option. I saw one person managed to hack a ""camping mode"" in their iD.3 by buckling an upside-down bin to the front seat So that's a potential option. Does anyone have any other good sleepable EV recommendations? 

EDIT: I'm seeing that Kia and Hyundai both offer a ""utility mode"" that does the same thing as camping mode so it looks like there are a few more options! The new Inster looks absolutely PERFECT for our needs. It's incredibly versatile, affordable, adorable, and even has a heat pump as standard",2024-07-08 11:35:03
1dxl401,Losing a few miles of charge in between use?,"Hi all,

I recently picked up an electric car (Peugeot E-208), didn't need anything fancy or long range efficient as I only do short journeys in my town (I commute locally for work).

It's been a lovely drive so far, it's smooth, it's nippy when I need it to be and otherwise all around a decent purchase. The only thing I've noticed however is the mileage range drops quite a lot in between each use.

I understand that a charge is always gonna drop over time, what with the central locking system and all, but I'm talking about a few miles in between use. For example, I'll start with 150, end up at my destination with 148, then when I'm at my job for several hours, and return to use the car to go home, it has dropped down to 143. The following day when I return to work, I've parked up at 141 miles, and started it back up to 136. This happens almost everytime now.

For reference, I drive it mainly in eco mode, and I'm very economical when driving anyway. The weather has been relatively mild, so I can't see the cold being a factor. It was pre-used, but only had 24k miles on the clock (4 year old car, 6k a year seemed reasonable use). Can anyone point as to what's going on, I'm almost losing ~40-50 miles in between each charge.",2024-07-07 16:56:01

For instance I liked the navigation app in the tesla for road trips that it plans the route based on the range and location of the superchargers, but I'm not aware if that is also possible with other brands...

  
Love to hear your thoughts and knowledge! Looking to make a decision soon on an EV.

  
Thanks!",2024-06-26 15:29:13

1doatcj,Nissan Leaf?,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm not a car person at all I need advises about getting a new car!

Is Nissan Leaf S reliable? I checked the prices of the used Nissan leaf and found them so affordable. What‚Äôs the catch? I need a car for commuting to work (within 20 minutes drive), getting groceries or going to the park with kiddos. We have a charger in our garage so I don‚Äôt think charging would be a problem. Is 2013 leaf a good bet? What else should I be worried about or be paying attention to when I go to the dealership? 

Would you go for a Nissan leaf or a Toyota Prius? I LOVED my Prius but it was t-boned and totaled long time ago. The price is just insane. I paid 7k for a 2012 one 5 years back, now with this budget I can only get a 2009 Prius.

Despite how much I love Prius, I would like to know if Nissan leaf is my good fit? I just want one that‚Äôs easy for short distance commute and ofc it has to be safe and easy to drive because I have kids to worry about. Also need it to be easily fixed or maintained too since I have zero knowledge about cars. 

Oh btw some Nissan Leaf on CARFAX are SUPER CHEAP like a 2013 around 3k or a 2015 around 4k. What‚Äôs the catch? It says they‚Äôre clean titles.

Thank you for your advice in advance!",2024-06-25 16:55:05
1do3n46,Dacia Spring not charging,"Hello! I bought a Dacia Spring a week ago and after two days I tried to charge it at home. The seller assured me it would be possible to charge it anywhere but it could take longer if I had low power at home. In 8h it charged 1% so I tried another power outlet and it didn't charge at all. I tried another one and it charged 5%, stopped charging, charged another 10% and then I turned it off because the cable was getting hot and it was getting late (I needed to leave my front door open in order to plug the cable in this outlet, while the first two are outside in the garage). I also noticed that my cable does not lock when I lock the car. What I mean is, I lock the car and I am still able to pull the cable off, which is not supposed to happen. My seller says I should keep trying to lock the cable and see if it keeps happening but I tried over 10 times and it only locked twice. Do you think it's a cable issue or a power issue?",2024-06-25 11:24:17

I know the obvious answer is the N Line, but it requires a much more significant wait (about half a year).

I've heard that the difference is about 60 miles between the two?

Took a quick look at the Splitvolt, which is meant to share a clothes dryer with your evse. But I‚Äôm not sure how it actually works. Best I can tell they‚Äôre probably just using a simple relay which looks for current draw from the dryer, then switches over to it when a low threshold is met. So the only time the evse gets power is when there‚Äôs no demand from the dryer. In my case the RV is probably always drawing something, if maybe just a few amps when ‚Äúidling‚Äù such as overnight. So I think I‚Äôd need a smart load balancing device, rather than a simple switch.

Anything made for this? I know smart chargers can handle doing two cars at once, and delegate how much power each one receives. So maybe there‚Äôs a good way to do this for other devices?",2024-06-08 22:06:49

1d6mbm7,Which of these used EV's should I buy? (Updated - VW vs Volvo) ,"Hey everyone,

This is an updated post based on feedback I received from my prior post.

I'm looking and financing a lightly used EV. I commute 75 miles a day for work and about 20,000 miles a year in total. I am currently commuting in my 2005 Ford F-250 5.4 Gasser getting 12MPG - meaning my gasoline spend every year is roughly $7500. Our electric rates are very low - 0.9 cents per kWh and that's accounting for peak usage times (WA has a lot of hydroelectricity, windmills, solar, etc)

**My life situation:** I own a Duplex where my girlfriend, myself and our two German shepherds live in one side and we rent out the other side for rental income. My girlfriend and I go to Portland (About 225 Mi away) once a month to pickup raw food for our dogs and we tend to try and make a trip out of it each time, occasionally travel to Western WA.

**My typical daily scenario:** 99% of the time - this car will simply be used to commute to and from work. 32.5 miles there, 32.5 miles back, generally from 6:00AM PST - 6:45AM PST then from 5:15PM PST - 6:00PM PST. Half of the year this is with daylight, half of the year it's dark both ways. Winters are unpredictable. Some years it will snow for 2 months, some years it won't snow, sometimes it only snows for a couple days, sometimes it snows in March.

**Cars I'm looking into (Updated):**

|Car|ID.4 Pro S Plus|ID.4 Pro/1st Edition|Polestar 2 w/ Pilot Pack|Volvo XC40|Volvo XC40 Ultimate or C40 Ultimate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Model Year**|2023|2021|2022|2021|2023|
|**Drivetrain**|AWD|RWD|AWD/FWD|AWD|AWD|
|**Mileage**|13,000|10,000|15,000|18,000|12,000|
|**Range**|255|250|249/275|208|223/226|
|**L2 Charge Speed**|11kW|11kW|11kW|11kW|11kW|
|**DCFC** **Charge Speed**|170kW|135kW|150kW|150kW|150kW|
|**Price (Before taxes and fees)**|$28,500|$25,000|$29,000|$30,000|$33,000|
|**Insurance cost**|$146 a month|$146 a month|$112 a month|$112 a month|$112 a month|

**Why these vehicles:** These are the one's I've essentially been able to find within 500 miles of my location or a dealership that delivers below the $30,000 price point. I've owned Bolt EV's in the past and heavily considered putting the Bolt EUV on the list - and as much as I don't think I'll travel that much, the idea of having to deal w/ 55kW peak DCFC speeds in 2024 does not sound appealing to me.

>**Volkswagen ID.4 Pros:** It's easy to find these in pretty much any configuration with low miles below the $30K price-point. Almost every configuration has 250+ miles of range. It seems like most come w/ a tow hitch, so if I wanted to get a small trailer and tow some hay short distances, or move furniture, it would be viable. Roomy interior. 11kW home charging, 130-170kW DCFC depending on model year is sufficient enough to be viable for travel. AWD variants would be nice during the work commute and Portland travel during the winter times.

>**Volkswagen ID.4 Cons:** Lack of true one pedal driving. Probably the most common non-Tesla EV on the road aside from maybe the Bolt and Nissan Leaf. Design is nice but it isn't awe inspiring. I've heard the infotainment is questionable - not sure how much I'd realistically use it. Performance on AWD is more than acceptable @ 0-60 in 5.5 seconds, but performance on RWD is not impressive.

>

>**Polestar 2 Pros:** Great looking vehicle inside and out. Performance on the dual motor is exciting - 0-60 in 4.4 seconds w/ the ability to pay $1500 for an OTA performance upgrade. Insurance is the cheapest I've been quoted for any EV I've looked at thus far.

>**Polestar 2 Cons:** Seemingly the most difficult to find out of the bunch. Pack system for these cars makes determining what features they have difficult - Pilot pack would essentially be a must for me. Most vehicles in this price range have all of these ""pack"" features as standard or minor trim upgrades. Single motor performance is not exciting, but extended range is nice - cost for single motor seems to be around the same for dual motor everywhere I look. A lot of the affordable ones are rental vehicles/fleet vehicles. Interior supposedly cramped.

>

>**Volvo XC40/C40 Pros:** Very similar to the Polestar but in an SUV format. Great looking vehicle, exciting performance, cheaper insurance.

>**Volvo XC40/C40 Cons:** Range on these is questionable. Supposedly the 2021 XC40 is only rated for 208 miles of range, but I heard that this was improved to match the 2022/2023 Model years via an OTA update, and that the EPA testing cycle changed in 2022. Price is in the upper range for such range.

>

**Hyundai Ioniq 5 Pros:** Fastest DCFC charging speeds would make road trips a breeze. Roomy interior. AWD would be great for the winter commutes. Performance is just as great as the Polestar 2's.

>**Hyundai Ioniq 5 Cons:** Subjective, but I'm not the biggest fan of the look of the car. I used to really love it, now it's ""Meh"" for me. These fall into the top of my budget - so most of them end up w/ payments similar to what Tesla was just offering w/ the Model Y and 0.99% financing. Insurance is nearly as expensive as what I was being quoted for Teslas.

>

**Vehicles I've ruled out:**

* **Any Tesla:** I was THIS close to financing a Model Y @ 0.99%. While I think it's difficult to deny the advantages Tesla has in the market, there's too many factors that turn me off from them. They don't inspire any sort of emotion from me - when I see one on the road, I don't point it out or get excited. I still do this today with ID.4's, Mach-E, Polstars, etc - but Tesla's are a dime a dozen. Major concerns over built quality, road noise and suspension. Girlfriend was a detailer for 4-years and hates Tesla's - claim their interior and paint quality are sub-par, even at their current pricing structure.
* **Mustang Mach-E**: Looks wise - these are second to the Polestar for me personally and just above the ID.4. These cars are surprisingly difficult to find under the $30,000 price range locally. When I do find them in that price range, they either have a ton of miles, or are in an absolute baseline trim w/ minimal features. 210 miles of range on the AWD variant and 230 miles on the RWD variant put them in the low-end of acceptable range for me. I've also heard complaints regarding the software and the charging speeds. I think winter range would be sketchy if I had to go to an appointment out of town on a work-day.
* **KIA Niro and Hyundai Kona**: Just too many compromises for me on these vehicles. 7.2kW L2 charging rate, 77kW max DCFC charging rate - they feel like a very slight step above the Bolt and Bolt EUV, but not enough to justify consideration. I will say - insurance on these cars is extremely cheap.
* **Suburu Solterra/Toyota Bz4x**: I'm probably one of the few people who doesn't mind these cars and they're somewhat tempting for the price-range I can find used models in. Unfortunate for these vehicles the insurance quote I got for these is simply too high for me to consider them - nearly 3x higher than the Polestar/Kona quoted costs. AWD version (Or Solterra) is rated for 228 miles of range which falls on the low-end of acceptable for me. Complaints about charging speed being realistically closer to 100kW make me think it'd be ""Okay"" for road trips but not great.
* **Chevrolet Bolt EV/EUV:** I actually have a soft-spot for these cars and they were a hard one for me to take off the consideration list. I've owned a 2021 and a 2022 Bolt EV several years ago and sold them both to lower my DTI so I could purchase my Duplex. Great cars for the money - that being said, I did a couple trips in them while I had them and while they're certainly possible, they aren't pleasant. Seats were always questionable and I'll be in a car for upwards of two-hours a day moving forward.
* **Jaguar I-Pace:** Cool car with impressive performance that has depreciated a TON - but dated interior and at this rate, 4-5 years old. Insurance costs quoted were on the higher end but less than Tesla/Solterra/Bz4x. Old infotainment - honestly - just too many compromises for this car for me to really take it as a serious consideration for the prices people want for them.
* **Mercedes EQB/Audi Q4 E-tron:** I'd love to consider both of these - but both are just outside of my budget when I come across them. They're also generally difficult to find in my area, but seem to be in abundance in Florida.
* **Nissan Ariya:** Insurance quotes are on the higher-end for this vehicle for some reason; $197 a month. While I can find FWD Ariya's with 280+ miles of range (Evolve+) and 300 miles of range (Venture+) the big kicker for me on this car is the 7.2kW maximum L2 charging rate. 
* I**oniq 5/6 and EV6:** I like these cars - but I'm having a hard time tracking any of them down w/ sub 20,000 miles and non-standard lower range variants. The EV6 Lite, Ioniq 5/6 SE Standard Range can be found in this price bracket, but then the range + RWD combo is not compelling enough for me to consider them.

**Alternative NEW option:** It does look like the 2024 Kona Electric SEL can be found for $30,000 flat. It also looks like dealer might be offering 1.99% @ 72 months. 260 miles of range, front-wheel drive only, max DCFC of 100KW, 11kW at home charging and supports V2L. I don't exactly LOVE the looks of this car - but - at it's price-point it could be compelling.

1d5za4w,Why? But why?,,2024-06-01 23:00:48
1d5xrra,Which of these used EV's should I buy? ,"Hey everyone,

I'm looking and financing a lightly used EV. I commute 75 miles a day for work and about 20,000 miles a year in total. I am currently commuting in my 2005 Ford F-250 5.4 Gasser getting 12MPG - meaning my gasoline spend every year is roughly $7500. Our electric rates are very low - 0.9 cents per kWh and that's accounting for peak usage times (WA has a lot of hydroelectricity, windmills, solar, etc)

**My life situation:** I own a Duplex where my girlfriend, myself and our two German shepherds live in one side and we rent out the other side for rental income. My girlfriend and I go to Portland (About 225 Mi away) once a month to pickup raw food for our dogs and we tend to try and make a trip out of it each time, occasionally travel to Western WA.

**My 99% scenario:** 99% of the time - this car will simply be used to commute to and from work. 32.5 miles there, 32.5 miles back, generally from 6:00AM PST - 6:45AM PST then from 5:15PM PST - 6:00PM PST. Half of the year this is with daylight, half of the year it's dark both ways. Winters are unpredictable. Some years it will snow for 2 months, some years it won't snow, sometimes it only snows for a couple days, sometimes it snows in March.

**Cars I'm looking into:**

|Car|ID.4 Pro S Plus|ID.4 Pro/1st Edition |Polestar 2 w/ Pilot Pack|Kona EV (1st gen)|Hyundai Ioniq 5|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Model Year**|2023|2021|2022|2023|2023|
|**Drivetrain**|AWD|RWD|AWD/FWD|FWD|AWD|
|**Mileage**|13,000|10,000|15,000|6,000|18,000|
|**Range**|255|250|249|258|266|
|**L2 Charge Speed**|11kW|11kW|11kW|7.2kW|11kW|
|**DCFC** **Charge Speed**|170kW|135kW|150kW|77kW|230kW|
|**Price**|$28,500|$25,000|$28,500|$23,000|$29,000|
|**Payment (Approx - Assuming sub 8% w/ 750+ credit score w/ 72 month financing)**|$466 a month|$440 a month|$466 a month|$405 a month|$527 a month|
|**Insurance cost**|$146 a month|$146 a month|$112 a month|$112 a month|$165 a month|
|**Total per month(Approx)**|$612|$586|$578|$517|$692 a month|

**Why these vehicles:** These are the one's I've essentially been able to find within 500 miles of my location or a dealership that delivers below the $30,000 price point. I've owned Bolt EV's in the past and heavily considered putting the Bolt EUV on the list - and as much as I don't think I'll travel that much, the idea of having to deal w/ 55kW peak DCFC speeds in 2024 does not sound appealing to me.



>**Volkswagen ID.4 Pros:** It's easy to find these in pretty much any configuration with low miles below the $30K price-point. Almost every configuration has 250+ miles of range. It seems like most come w/ a tow hitch, so if I wanted to get a small trailer and tow some hay short distances, or move furniture, it would be viable. Roomy interior. 11kW home charging, 130-170kW DCFC depending on model year is sufficient enough to be viable for travel. AWD variants would be nice during the work commute and Portland travel during the winter times.

>**Volkswagen ID.4 Cons:** Probably the most common non-Tesla EV on the road aside from maybe the Bolt and Nissan Leaf. Design is nice but it isn't awe inspiring. I've heard the infotainment is questionable - not sure how much I'd realistically use it. Performance on AWD is more than acceptable @ 0-60 in 5.5 seconds, but performance on RWD is not impressive.

>

>**Polestar 2 Pros:** Great looking vehicle inside and out. Performance on the dual motor is exciting - 0-60 in 4.4 seconds w/ the ability to pay $1500 for an OTA performance upgrade. Insurance is the cheapest I've been quoted for any EV I've looked at thus far.

>**Polestar 2 Cons:** Seemingly the most difficult to find out of the bunch. Pack system for these cars makes determining what features they have difficult - Pilot pack would essentially be a must for me. Most vehicles in this price range have all of these ""pack"" features as standard or minor trim upgrades. Single motor performance is not exciting, but extended range is nice - cost for single motor seems to be around the same for dual motor everywhere I look. A lot of the affordable ones are rental vehicles/fleet vehicles. Interior supposedly cramped. 

>

>**Kona EV Pros:** Pricing is just above what I'm seeing for Bolt EUV's with slightly higher range and slighter faster DCFC charging speeds. Insurance is just as cheap as it is for the Polestar 2. 

>**Kona EV Cons:** 7.2kW home charging as opposed to 11kW. 77kW DCFC is still relatively slow. Only available in FWD, which is better for snow than RWD, but not quiet as great as AWD. 

>  
**Hyundai Ioniq 5 Pros:** Fastest DCFC charging speeds would make road trips a breeze. Roomy interior. AWD would be great for the winter commutes. Performance is just as great as the Polestar 2's. 

>**Hyundai Ioniq 5 Cons:** Subjective, but I'm not the biggest fan of the look of the car. I used to really love it, now it's ""Meh"" for me. These fall into the top of my budget - so most of them end up w/ payments similar to what Tesla was just offering w/ the Model Y and 0.99% financing. Insurance is nearly as expensive as what I was being quoted for Teslas.

1d5x52j,What to choose? Need station waggon or SUV,"Hi everyone!

Glad to be joining here.
So I kind of need some advice. I have absolutely no clue about cars and even less about electric ones.
My new job wants me to choose a station waggon (kombi for my German friends) or an suv as a company car and they really want me to choose an electric one.
For context, I will work as a handyman ( electrician in the securityfield) so I will need to fit some material (most of it will be shipped to the sites, just gotta have some hundred meters of cables), tools and my obligatory pink dress with me. (The dress was a joke, I only wear skirts,jk)
I will also be travelling a lot, like 80% of jobs are way over 500km away.
My options for brands are: Ford, Mercedes, Fiat, Skods, Audi, Hyundai and MG.
Anyone got some recommendations? 

Thanks in advance.
Love you all
Tom

1d5pv6x,Home charger questions,"So Im currently building a new house (in Europe). Im at a stage where Im designing / implementing electricity inside of the house.  I already have solar panels (23x450W) and a 10kW energy store for the house.
I would like to have a home charger some time in the future as well. Not sure what car I will have. Currently Im leaning towards Polestar 2 long range (most likely) or VW ID.7 or Skoda Eniaq. I would also like to be able to plug in my car and that my home can draw energy from the car if needed / during the night. 


Few questions then:

1. What kind of wire I should use from the distribution box to the wall charger outlet ? 

2. Should I just plug it to the home network after the inverter or have some sort of DC connection from the photovoltaic installation ?

3. Is there anything to consider (tell the electricians) if I want to use my car to power my home ?

Any other things I should consider ?",2024-06-01 15:45:00

1d41981,Ford charging at Tesla Supercharger - just BS marketing,"Sorry to rant but I have been a Tesla guys since the first roadster. So two years ago I decided to get a Ford Lightning and I love it. The problem is the charging networks outside of Tesla suck. So I was thrilled to hear we can now charge at the same network that is available anywhere. I have done cross country trips with my model S and was looking forward to doing the same with my Lightning. Here is the problem. I can‚Äôt get the adapter to let me charge at Tesla Superchargers. Even though I put the order in as soon as I got the email, my adapter won‚Äôt arrive until late September. I call Ford and I got ‚Äúit is what it is‚Äù answer. Yet on YouTube you see all these YouTubers with the adapter and showing us how great it is. Tesla is a master at this also. Announce or sell something like the cybertruck and set a delivery date of late 2027. I am a huge supporter of EVs but they have to get the model together. Better alignment of delivery and manufacturing with promises are key to avoid frustration. Frankly I am getting to the point where I am considering going back to ICE - something I have never thought I would say. I believe for EV to truly replace ICE vehicles there needs to be a paradigm shift. Manufacturing and delivering products on a reasonable timeframe is key to create customer satisfy and long term loyalty.

This is my first post here.

I m torn between an Mach e and Ioniq 6 (United Kingdom)

I love the Bluecruise in the Mach E and seats were comfortable during the 48hr test drive ,but the cameras weren't that great and the Charging speeds are about 47 mins for 20 to 80 percent.The Mustang has a higher range on paper due to bigger battery size

With the Ioniq I was blown away by how cool the interior is for the price and how smooth the steering was and the multiple options with the Ipedal and manual and auto regen.The leather seats were a bit rigid and I felt the head rest was pushing in too much and dealers aren't giving any more than 20 mins Test drives on Ioniq 6.

I get pain in my elbow during long drives hence I am leaning towards Mach e purely for the Bluecruise and possibly better seats.

I'm currently doing this is a truck that gets 12MPG and it's costing me a fortune. I live in WA, electric rate is 9 cents per kWh. I own a Duplex where I live in one side and rent out the other side. Brand new MPU, would just have to pay to get a 220/240V plug installed and routed to the driveway. This year I will bring in $91,000 between my salary, bonuses and rental income. I have a 755 Experian score based off of FICO8 standards, others should be close to this and I'm expecting the score to go up rapidly as I've paid down recurring credit debt significantly. I've been looking into EV's and I'm considering various options. I've created a spreadsheet below:

|Car|Suburu Solterra|Kia Niro|Chev Bolt EUV|Tesla Model 3|Tesla Model Y|Polestar 2|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Mileage|25,000|17,000|7500|46,000|0|17,000|
|Range|228|239|247|271|310|249|
|Charge speed|147kW|77kW|55kW|170kW|250kW|155kW|
|APR|8.76|9.5|8.76|9.5|2.99|8.76|
|Price|$26,156.56|$24,178.13|$19,654.12|$24,995.00|$44,666|$23,099|
|Payment|$470|$443.55|$353.19|$517.14|$541.00|$443|
|Insurance cost|$147|$56|$85.75|$110|$140|$49|
|Total monthly|$617|$499.55|$438.94|$627.14|$681.00|$492.00|

Some things that stand out for me:

* The promotional interest rate available for the Model Y is very tempting - primarily because it takes a brand new car and put's it within roughly a $120 payment difference for cars that are several years old.
* Once I get into the $30K price range for a used EV, the used rates being somewhere between 7%-9% end up putting me at payments beyond that of the Model Y payments. The delta has to be big enough for me to really consider it as a viable option.
* Tesla having NACS is a plus for me - however, I am not opposed to using adapters for CCS > NACS if the savings are significant enough.
* The insurance quote I got for full-coverage on the Polestar 2 and KIA NIRO are is shockingly low in comparison to most of the other vehicles on the list.
* I used to own two Bolt EV's, so I am pretty confident I'd like the Bolt EUV - but in 2024 the 55kW max charging rate concerns me and makes the vehicle practically impossible to utilize for trips. We do have a 2014 Nissan Maxima we currently use for most trips.
* My biggest priorities are (1. Range - I want to be able to drive 33 miles to work, then be able to drive 40 miles out of town for a doctors appointment, then potentially 40 miles back to work or home, even in the winter without having to worry about charging. (2. Safety - I have to drive on single-lane ""carriageway"" @ 60-70mph speeds for a good portion of my commute. (3. Music/Nav - I have to be able to play music from my phone and use navigation without major issues.

We both study in one of the bigger cities in Denmark, and we would need the car range to be 140km on highway - preferably a bit between 140-200km. Our budget is maximum 16k EUR (17k USD). Most important is efficiency and safety/reliability. We have looked at the following models:

* Hyundai Ioniq 28kWh from 2018, 90k km.
* VW E-up from 2021, 49k km
* Nissan Leaf 40 tekna from 2018, 46k km
* Skoda Citigoe from 2020, 53k km

Do anyone have experience or any recommendations/critic with any of the models?

Thank you for the help!",2024-05-21 08:18:59
1cwo7ij,"No, I don't need a level 2 charge installed in my garage.","I've now had my EV for a few months and often when I tell someone that I've got an EV, they ask if I got a level 2 charger installed in my garage; I don't really see the need. I work from home and most of my trips are to grocery stores, Costco, tennis matches, etc. I don't think I have ever used more than 20-25% of my battery in a single day (I only charge to 80%)

If I was going on a long trip, I could start the 100% charge a few days early (I have not done this yet), or if in a single day, I needed more than a single charge, I could go to a public charger (I have not used one yet) 

I have seen a few articles saying people often don't need 300 miles ev range (I don't but my car has this), or awd (I don't have this, snows here once every 5-6 years for a day or two at most) but I have not seen articles about the fact that a lot of us also don't need level 2 chargers; 110 works just fine for some of us.  
  
People just assume, if you have an ev, you also need a level 2 charger.",2024-05-20 19:33:37
1cvkgzr,Charging cables compliance and possible insurance exclusion,"Hello guys, 

i recently took delivery of a PHEV Cupra Formentor, which came without a type 2 to type 2 charging cable. I was looking to purchase one, however i do not want to get the genuine vw one since its priced at around 300 euros. It doesnt really make sense to spend this amount since its an LTR that i got through my company policy. 

I couldnt really find anything online about charging cable compliance in the EU (should these cables have some kind of certification? And if so which one?).

Will using a non-genuine charging cable nullify my insurance coverage in case of fire or other damage caused to the vehicle while charging?

Thanks in advance !",2024-05-19 09:34:41

I‚Äôve accepted at this point that I will be taking a loss to sell back to the dealership but at the moemnt the loss is pretty substantial at around 20k due to the value of the car in the current ev market.

1cpx700,Which will live longer - 10 year old Tesla S or 4 year old Bolt EV?,"I have saved up $15,000 to buy my 1st EV, and I plan to drive it into the ground, just like I've done with my 20 year old Scion. I have been leaning towards a 2019-20 Bolt EV Premier because it is small and cheap and practical. But today an opportunity arose to buy a 2015 Tesla Model S from a guy I kinda know, and now I'm confused.

In my area I can choose from used 2019-2020 Bolt Premier EVs from the dealer with tax credit for $15,000. Most seem to have 20,000-30,000 miles already and batteries that have been replaced in the past 2 years. They will include the manufacturer's 10 year / 100,000 mile warranty, their capabilities are a good match for my commute, I can charge at home, and it's what I've been planning to do, until ...

I was given the opportunity to buy a 2015 Tesla Model S for my $15,000 budget. It has 115,000 miles and is no longer under any warranty. It would be a private sale from a guy who's taken very good care of it. I've never wanted to be a Tesla person, just a practical commuter who's trying to save gas money and reduce my carbon impact. I like a tiny car that's easy to park and hard to worry about. But I drove the Tesla today, and it sure is nice in a land-yacht kind of way. We have another ICE car for road trips, so the Bolt wouldn't hold us back, but if I had a Tesla I would absolutely road trip in it. I'm also a little embarrassed at how much I liked the Auto Pilot feature. Kelly Blue Book says this car's Fair market range is between $17,800-$21,200, so it feels like a good deal maybe.

I'm trying to stay focused on my primary goal of getting the longest lasting car I can for my budget. I am concerned about the cost of fixing the Tesla if things do go wrong, vs having at least 8 more years of warranty coverage for the Bolt. I am curious about the expected lifespan of these cars, and I know we don't have the data yet. So I'm looking for advice and anecdotes and the thoughts of other EV drivers about durability and long term reliability of either of these cars. What would you do, if this car was going to be the last one you owned for a long time?",2024-05-12 02:06:54
